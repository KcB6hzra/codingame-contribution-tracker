    "content": "Hello.\nI got this in reverse mode, and it was pretty cool.\nI had a discrepancy between tests and validators, though, from 100% to 83%, and I've figured out why:\nThe binary validator has 0 in the tenths (.01). In a hurry, and not trusting floats, I printed the number / 100, then \".\", then the number %100. I see why that was a mistake, and I could have easily corrected it, but that one validator is the only place there's a 0 after the decimal point.\nMaybe having one of the tests with a .0n would alert others who make this mistake before they submit.",

It takes a minute to get one's bearings, but once you realize the abacus is just a representation of a positional number system (like decimal, binary, etc.), it's very approachable. Looking forward to solving this one. Great job!",
