But unfortunately this does not work for all cases. To validate my code, I created two tests :\n\nTest 1:\nin:\n15 0 4\n8 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 Gray city1 city2\n4 0 Gray city3 city4\n4 0 Gray city5 city6\n1 0 Gray city7 city8\nout:\n30\n\nTest 2:\nin:\n15 0 4\n8 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 Gray city1 city2\n4 0 Gray city3 city4\n3 0 Gray city5 city6\n2 0 Gray city7 city8\nout:\n28\n\nAnd unfortunately yours fails on the second one.\n\nRegards",

    "content": "Hello, I have never played this game and it seems to be a very good puzzle. In my opinion is the goal bit long and and a bit hard to understand (I have not check the result for the moment). So I just rewrite here with a few changes. That is just a suggestion.\n\n--\n\nTicket to Ride is a classic board game by Alan Moon and Days of Wonder in which you earn points by connecting cities via completed train routes. Based on this game, the goal of this puzzle is to calculate the maximum score that you can achieve. \n\nYou will be provided information about the starting game state, including:\n- Number of trainCars you are allowed to use\n- Cards in your hand, each are showing 1 trainCar in a color or 1 engine. Each card can only be used one time.\n- Tickets in your hand, each are showing two cities and how much bonus points you earn by connecting them (directly or not)\n- Available routes on the board and conditions to complete them\n\nEach route in the game has:\n- A length, indicating how many trainCars are needed to complete the route.\n- A color, indicating which color of cards are needed to complete the route.\n- Two cities that will be connected once the route has been completed.\n\nYou get points for completing routes, according to this table for each route:\n- lenght 1: 1 point\n- lenght 2: 2 points\n- lenght 3: 4 points\n- lenght 4: 7 points\n- lenght 6: 15 points\n- lenght 8: 21 points\n\nEach engine cards can replace 1 trainCard of any color. Gray routes can be completed with cards of any color, but all cards used for a Gray route must be the same color (potentially supplemented with engines).\nFor example, a Gray route of length 3 could be completed:\n- with 3 pink cards,\n- with 2 black cards and 1 engine,\n- but not with 2 blue cards and 1 green card.\n\nSome Gray routes require that one or more of the cards played on them must be an engine.\nFor example, a route of length 3 with requiredEngines equal to 1 could be completed:\n- with 2 red cards and 1 engine,\n- with 1 black and 2 engines,\n- but not with 3 blue cards,\n- and not with 1 green, 1 yellow, and 1 engine.\n\nGlobal example with:\n- a ticket awarding 5 bonus points for connecting Athina and Angora\n- a route of length 2 between Athina and Smyrna,\n- and a route of length 3 between Smyrna and Angora.\nWith these routes completed you get the 5 bonus points received for connecting (in 2 parts here) Athina to Angora + the 6 points (lenght 2: 2 points + lenght 3: 4 points) received for completing the two routes = 11 points.",
