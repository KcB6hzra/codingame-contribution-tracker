For example with a full alphabet (26 letters) 'hello' would be 7073801.\n\nGet it done agent !",

Using languages which encode strings as utf8, this has to be handled. E.g. in Rust \"°\".len() != \"°\".chars().count(). And Validator 6 does not reflect this, containing no special char. But better than the other way round ;).\n- Maybe you want to rename the variable \"A\" in your code stub also to \"C\"\n- \"INPUT\" : Caractères => characters, or maybe better \"coding alphabet\" ?\n- \"OUTPUT\" combinaison => combinations. Maybe \"the pth combination of characters of the coding alphabet\".\n- \"Constraints\" : \"Do a BrutForce modulable\" Not sure what this means? Maybe \"Use brute force\"?",
