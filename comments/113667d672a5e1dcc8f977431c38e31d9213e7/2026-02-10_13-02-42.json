    "content": "Goal\n* You misspelled \"triangle\" as \"trianle\".\n\n* The statement should be more detailed. Suggest to rewrite as follows:\n\nGiven an integer [[N]], you must create a right triangle pattern of [[N]] rows. Each row [[i]] should be of length [[i]]. The first and last rows should be filled with {{*}}, while the intermediate rows should have {{*}} at the beginning and end, with spaces in between.\n\nOutput\n* Please add \"<<[[N]] rows>>:\" in front of the description.\n\n* Please format \"*\" as a {{constant}} and remove the quotation marks.\n\nThanks.",
