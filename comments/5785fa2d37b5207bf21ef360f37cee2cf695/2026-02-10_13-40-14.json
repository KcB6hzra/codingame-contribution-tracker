    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: Although I'm pretty sure there is already a challenge like this in the system, It won't hurt if we have 2 versions of it. But I'm not 100% sure there is one in the system, so yours must get in.\nLike @lopidav stated, each validator needs to be similar (but not identical) to its previous test case. That way, a user that writes his code like so: \"if input()=='80 85 90 100 105 115' print('PUZdis')\" and so on for every test case (which is visible to him/her), his code will still fail because of the invisible validators. Also, because it's your first contribution, I'll approve it. Please contribute more and upvote and approve/reject other's work too. Good luck :)",

    "content": "Some corrections that I've done:\nChanged the input/output descriptions a little but it doesn't matter since players will not see it.\nChanged stab so it reads only one string and changed this string to be 255 chars long since you have a validator that has input 233 chars long.\n\nAnasShami, there is some stuff that you might not know:\n\nThere are two types of tests: actual tests and validators.\nPlayers will see actual testes (their input/output) but they will not see validators. It's done so players can't just hardcode test cases and get 100%.\nBut if the player's code would pass all of the testes but it'll not get 100% on the validators then your puzzle will get poorly rated and will be filtered out.\nSo you need to make each validator similar to the previous test.\nAlso, you can let validators be unnamed since they will be ever visible only on this page.\n\nSpecifically in the reverse mode players also can't see the statement, input/output descriptions, and constraints. So you put some placeholder in those fields if you're making a puzzle exclusively for the Reverse.",
