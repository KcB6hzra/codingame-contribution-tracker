    "content": "Very hard for a clash in the end... BFS is always tough for 5-15 minutes.\n\nI ended up beaten by a bot, which sucks. I got 75% and came second in Fastest mode. Bot got 100% at the last second. One human player got 25%, the rest got 0%.\n\nThe last test cases are tough enough that I wasn't able to optimise my code in time. My code was good, but I didn't notice that I was over-generating my queue in each step of the BFS, meaning that I was checking some cells multiple times per iteration, which was blowing out as the iterations got bigger... \".uniq\" was all I needed to fix in the end, but debugging is always hard when you've only solved the problem in the last few minutes.",

Please be consistent in the variable names: I think the width in the Input section is stored in [[m]] instead of [[w]]?\n\n4. Goal section and Output sections: You may format the strings as constants like this: {{P}}, {{T}}, {{.}}, {{x}}, {{hurray!!}} and {{arghhh!}} instead of using quotation marks.\n\n5. The constraints have to be revised as 1 ≤ [[n]] ≤ 10 and 1 ≤ [[m]] ≤ 10, otherwise Test 3 and Validator 3 will violate the constraints as 10 is not less than 10.\n\n6. I would suggest to vary the validators slightly more by swapping the positions of P and T.\n\nThanks.",
