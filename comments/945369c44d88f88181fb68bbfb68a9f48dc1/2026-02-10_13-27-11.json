Very nice.\nWas fun to solve too.  =)\n\nI'd suggest you reformat the description a bit,\nit could be a bit more readable in my opinion. \nWhat about something like this?\n\n```\nSomeone just told you all roads lead to Rome.\nAs a matter of fact, this is not true.\n\nIn order to restore scientific truth, you must write \na program that counts the actual number of paths from Paris to Rome\nwhere any city is at most visited once per. path.\n\nTo start with, you're given a collection of all \npaths that directly connect individual cities\nand where each city is defined by a number from 1 to 100.\n\nParis has label 1, and Rome has label 100.\n\n...\n```",

    "content": "I understand and I was wondering too if it was better as a \"medium\" or \"easy\" puzzle. \nI chose \"medium\" because to me, working with graphs isn't a part of the mose basic stuff you can do when programming (which would be conditions, calculus, distances, text manipulations, ...).\nAlso, it has to do with recursion, which I consider as the \"elevator\" from a beginner level to a medium one.\nAnd finally, I saw in the comments that many people think about BFS to solve it, which works. I'm not an expert myself but I think this might be more elegant to design a more specific answer to the problem, which is only about counting (and do nothing else with) a collection of paths where we know for sure they may never be infinite.\n\nI would be interested in collecting other people's opinions about this question: easy or medium difficulty?",
