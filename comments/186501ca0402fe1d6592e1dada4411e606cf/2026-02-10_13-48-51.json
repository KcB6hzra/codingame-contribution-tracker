Perhaps the nomenclature is standard and I'm just not used to it, but if other people have the same issue, this may be something to look into. Especially if it was a speed challenge :)\n\n2) The default generated input code (at least in PHP) is wrong.\n\nProvided:\nfscanf(STDIN, \"%d\",\n    $N\n);\nfscanf(STDIN, \"%d\",\n    $x\n);\n\nWhich, doesn't work. What it needs is:\nfscanf(STDIN, \"%d %d\",$N,$x);\n\nI'm not sure how to adjust this, but if someone knows I'd be interested to find out :)",
