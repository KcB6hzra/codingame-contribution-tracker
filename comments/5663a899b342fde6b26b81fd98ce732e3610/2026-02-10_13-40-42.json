    "content": "Nice puzzle. I think the statement would be clearer if you introduced the concept of grid formally : \"A gold mining operation works on a mxn area containing a certain amount of gold. To make exploitation simple, the area is divided as a grid of squares of size kxk. Each day, the miner mines one of those kxk square completely, until the whole area has been mined. (In total, there will be (m/k)*(n/k) days of mining.)\"\n\nI think it is better, because it is clear that we divide the area in a grid, while in your statement, you have to combine the information that only kxk squares are mined, that they shouldn't overlap, that all the area should be mined, and that the area exactly fits those squares since m%k==n%k==0. Your constraints define a grid, so stating it is one from the get go would make it less convoluted.\n\nReading the statement for the first time, i was trying to understand if this was a backtracking problem where any square could be considered (even if \"what is the maximum amount of gold in one day\" makes no sense in that case).",
