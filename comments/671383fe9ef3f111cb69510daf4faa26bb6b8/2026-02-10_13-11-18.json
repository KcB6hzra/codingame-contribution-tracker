Alternatively I would suggest to simplify it so that it is \"easy\":\n\n* removing the starting corner and direction, and having it always be `topLeft` and `clockwise`;\n* have only one \"short string\" like `D3` and make the letters always grow by one;\n* and size always < 31 as a constraint.\n\nWith any of those changes I'd approve it (but I still have a few levels to go for that).",

I am not in love with :The background and Scenario sections.\n\nBackground:\nI don't want to be told to go watch a movie and hearing about someone else's exploits has nothing to do with this puzzle. I get that is what inspired you but it doesn't add anything to the puzzle. \n- possible solutions would be to give the movie a shout out but also give us a first person update to our epic alien riddle solving dilema.\n\nThis Scenario:\nWhy does it say another attempt? and 'as a potential-vehicle for some wild space-time multiverse travel adventures.'\n\n-This kinda takes me out of the scenario as it just requires me to go watch a movie.\n-I enjoy puzzles that are more stand alone. They give me everything i need to feel engaged in the write up.\n-You can just let us know their intentions are a mystery.",
