I ended up winning my clash with just 20% because everyone else got 0% including 3 bots. :/",

Even simply creating the digit lookup array in your provided solution takes 20 select+copy+pastes. Alternatively, those two lines can be parsed and converted into the digit array in code which is fast to type but still more work than some entire clashes.\n\nThe idea itself is good though and it would work well as an easy puzzle.",
