    "content": "It would be good to have a test case that ends in \"0\" and has multiple digits (>2), like \"230\".\n\nI just got this in shortest mode and made a bad call that got me 100% on tests but 75% on validators. It was due to evaluating the reversed strings into integers, but in Ruby when you evaluate \"032\" (230 backwards) it assumes it's octal and evaluates to 26 rather than 32.\n\nSilly mistake, but it would be nice if such edge cases were debuggable in the test cases and not just validators. Fun clash though!",

    "content": "Maybe I misunderstood the goal, but it appears to me that you're asking to build a palindromic number starting from your input value. In my opinion, the word 'hidden' would imply that the palindrome already lies in your input value, which is not the case.\n\nIf this exercise is based on a mathematical theorem (which you imply from your first sentence : For almost every integer resides a hidden palindrome), I would suggest to add a reference to the corresponding maths.",
