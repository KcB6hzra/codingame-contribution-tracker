Each one is not too much more work, but the infinite solutions one for example is not obvious.\nWas fun once solved, but not solvable in 5 minutes by most clashers I'd say.",

    "content": "The solution is very interesting in terms of code golfing!\nI learned to use exit() instead of a else.\nI am far from being a pro, but you can remove the space between the \"-1\" and the \"if\" line 6.\n\nThat said, the problem is fun. Maybe you can precise that when there is only one solution, you should still double the output, instead of discovering it in Test 5 if we do not pay attention to the output.\n\nBut it is strange to see parenthesis in the output. If I needed such program, I would ask it to output each intersection point on its own line, and with X and Y only separated by space (better for parsing). Even your input in separated by space, without parenthesis.",
