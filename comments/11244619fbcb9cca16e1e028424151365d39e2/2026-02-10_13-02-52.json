    "content": "Fantastic clash idea but there is a bug you need to test for before publishing, one validation will do the trick.\n\nYou need to add a test case where one of the strings other than the first is longer than or equal to 10 char, otherwise I can solve by splitting the input using ':' as the separator, then printing each item except for the first up to its last character.\n\nI got perfect using this method despite having completly circumvented the point, and having a non guaranteed solution.\nPython:\nline = input()\nl = line.split(':')\n\nfor i in range(1, len(l)):\n    print( (l[i]) [:-1]  ) \n\nexample where this wouldn't work:\n\nl5:hello10:helloworlde\n\nmy code would output:\nhello1\nhelloworld",

    "content": "It would be nice to mention that the string may also contain digit characters.\nIt is not a problem for reverse as the fourth test contains it, but for the fastest it is not so clear until run tests.\n\nIt would be nicer (especially for reverse) to have uppercase L and E as start and end instead of lowercase. I always tend to read l5 as 15",

    "content": "Since author never responded, I've just replaced the one validator that had 10 characters (Validator 1).\n\nThis was an issue because for Reverse mode all of the tests had at most one digit before the ':', so it was unfair to have a validator with '10:'.\n\nI got 75% in reverse mode because of this and it is pretty hard to deal with this edge case when digits can appear in the actual text.",
