    "content": "I really enjoyed your puzzle, thanks a lot.\n\nI managed to implement my own solution and pass all the test cases, but there are a couple of points that I feel could be improved:\n \n1. The way the values assigned to the rows are chosen is not completely clear: trying a few different cases, it appears that the value of the 2nd row is the index of the first blank column encountered (and the 3rd row, the value of the second blank)... That's the intuitive solution, but another \"valid\" choice would be to pick the smallest of the value for the 2nd row and the biggest for the 2rd row. An additional clarification --- or the choice of an example invalidating the second choice --- may be beneficial... Although (suprisingly?) you can pass all the test cases and validators either way.\n\n2. I kind of dislike the necessecity of treating slashes differently depending of whether we are encrypting or decrypting: in the former, you want to ignore slashes when translating the string into numbers, but keep them when translating numbers back into a string (after the modular addition), whereas the reverse is true when decrypting (keep slashes in the 1st step, discard them in the 2nd step). Thus, an decrypted string cannot have slashes whereas a encrypted string can.\nI realise that this is required as you could end up with a number that does not have a corresponding string if you always get rid off slashes (e.g. a string ending with a single '2' or '6' in your example, or a slash that is not followed by anything).\nHowever, this can simply be fixed by adding the 1st digit of the header (or any digit that does not correspond to a blank space) after the modular addition (and conversely removing the last digit before the modular subtraction when decrypting).\n\nTwo very minor (and controversial) points actually... If you feel that your puzzle is better off without these two suggestions, just say so and I will approve it!\nGreat contribution anyway :)",

    "content": "Frankly the challenge is to understand how your encryption works. I used a full A4 sheet trying to understand why my code didn't work and gave up.\n\nFor one thing your first example doesn't match the problem description. This makes debugging pretty painful, since you can't follow the intermediate steps.\n\nThen you don't explain exactly how the '/' and '.' are inserted. See the table I get below. Starting from zero, the '/' at position 12 should be placed on 2nd row 3rd column, or shouldn't it?\n\nThen your example pattern is a multiple of the key's length, so it's not clear whether the key should be synchronized with the message from the left or from the right, i.e with key 0123 and a message of length 10, should it be matched against  0123/0123/01 or 23/0123/0123 ?\n\nFollowing your description, I get this for test 1:\n\nE T * A O N * R I S\nB C / D F G H J K .\nL M P Q U V W X Y Z\n\nIAMABRUT --(substitue)--> 8/3/61/3/20/7/64/1 --(modulo)-->8/7/9/3/3/63/9/68/4 --(recode)-->IRSAAQSYO\n\nObviously that's not the expected result, but I'd rather have the problem description help me figure out what's wrong than fiddle blindly with my code.",

This makes sense because we do not want to mess up with the passphrase and 1st row: '/' and '.' can only be inserted in the 2nd or 3rd row.\nBut I agree that it definitely would not hurt to precise it in the specifications.\n\nSecondly, the key is synchronised from the left, as you can see from the example, where the length of the encoded message is NOT a multiple of the length of the key (see the 0 in the right most position?). But again, this is a valid point and adding an extra clarification would probably be good.\n\nHopefully, this should get you going (in particular, the 1st issue: you have not positioned '/' and '.' correctly --- the device in the 1st test case is identical to the device described in the statment).",
