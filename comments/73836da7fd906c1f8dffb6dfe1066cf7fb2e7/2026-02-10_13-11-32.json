The other link is:\nhttps://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/738370dfde913a9cbc40763c82d11fd79f523\n\nGoal section\n* Please format \"T\", \"J\", \"Tom wins\" and \"Jerry wins\" as {{constants}} and remove the quotation marks.\n\n* Please mention how each position should be represented in the output (e.g. the leftmost character is at position 0, and the position increases to the right, 1 position per character).\n\n* Please mention whether any trailing spaces in the race course should be removed.\n\nInput section\n* Please change the three line numbers like this: \"<<Line 1>>\" (and Lines 2 and 3 similarly, <<>> is the bold syntax).\n\nOutput section\n* Please add line numbers (there should be 3 lines in total).\n\nConstraints section\n* Please delete the first constraint (that should be mentioned in Output section instead, and \"sreen\" is a typo).\n\n* Please move the third constraint to Goal section as it's a requirement, not a constraint.\n\n* Please fix the typo: \"diffenrent\" => \"different\".\n\n* Please mention that there will always be a winner and never a tie.\n\nStub generator\n* Please use the same variable name as other sections (\"tomStart\" instead of \"tomStartPos\").\n\n* Please add a write statement (e.g. \"write answer\").\n\nThanks.",

Please rewrite it using the format of \"<<Line _>>: line description\" here, so that Line 1 refers to Tom's course, Line 2 refers to Jerry's course and Line 3 refers to the winner message.\n\n* After the rewriting as mentioned, the following lines should be deleted (and as I said, \"sreen\" is a typo anyway):\n\"Tom is always shown on the first line and Jerry on the second line of the sreen.\"\n\"There should be 3 lines in total\"\n\nGoal section\n* Please add \"on the course filled with the space character\" after \"at the finish\".\n\n* Please mention whether any trailing spaces in the output should be removed.\n\nConstraints section\n* Please delete \"Distances are represented by space\". It is a requirement, not a constraint.\n\n* Please mention that there will always be a winner and never a tie.\n\nThanks again.",
