    "content": "Hello fellow citizen. Thank you for your upvote and for your advice.\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed the puzzle and that it led you to encounter Faulhaber's polynomials.\n\nIt's fascinating to discover and programmatically build direct calculation formulas for power sums, and then evaluate them within the same program.\n\nFaulhaber is just an appetizer; he is the precursor to the Bernoulli revolution. I'm thinking about how to stage Episode 2, especially in terms of application and gamification. But the idea is to go much further, using the best methods available today to calculate Bernoulli numbers (Harvey's algorithm). Beyond the application of power sums, this topic connects with the Euler-Maclaurin formula and the Riemann Zeta function.\n\nFrom an algorithmic perspective, it’s challenging in terms of complexity. There’s also a lot of implementation related to prime numbers and modular arithmetic, involving extended Euclidean algorithms and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which is fascinating and a valuable skill set for a computer scientist.\n\nThat said, I'm not sure the topic will get the green light within 27 days, as it might be too math-heavy for some. \n\nI look forward to seeing you in Episode II, which I'll probably put in the contribution queue next week.\n\nFor the tests in Episode 1, I'll update with N = [9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 69, 99, 139]. Around 140, the basic recurrence for calculating Bernoulli numbers starts to struggle, even with memoization. And I want to avoid pushing the player further than this initial discovery step in Episode 1.",

    "content": "I marked it as 'Easy' by default, waiting for feedback, but it might actually be 'Medium' or even 'Hard' right from the start. If one has to solve it from scratch, you’d need to be a Pascal, Faulhaber, or Bernoulli. But today, with a bit of research on power sums, players will inevitably come across Faulhaber’s formulas and Bernoulli polynomials (cf. my ref to Ada Lovelace's G Note). From there, it’s less about designing from scratch and more about translating recurrence formulas into code. However, it still requires knowing how to manipulate arrays, work with recursion, and think about memoization.\n\nEpisode 2: It would be about exploring modular cycle detection, particularly related to some properties listed in [https://oeis.org/A031971](https://oeis.org/A031971) and [https://oeis.org/A014117](https://oeis.org/A014117).
