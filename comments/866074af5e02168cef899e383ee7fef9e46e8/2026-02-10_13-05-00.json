    "content": "The statement is very unclear. I had to look at the test cases and your example code. It was still unclear (because I didn't spend a long time on your example code). I finally guessed at what needed to be done, and implemented that. I currently pass only the first test case and validator 3 and 4, and sometimes test 4.\n\nI have gathered a list of statements. I think these are all true, but I couldn't find any of this info in your statement. Can you verify if this is true, and if so, update your statement to include this info in some way?\n- Every letter always gets mapped to the same letter. For clarity, let's call the map that decrypts the message the letter map.\n- You map all words from the cipher to a word in the word list to construct the letter map.\n- The mapping between words is a one-to-one correspondence: every word in the word list gets mapped to exactly once, and every word in the cipher can only map to one word in the word list. Same thing for the letter map.\n- Not every word needs to be used in the mapping.\n- Let's consider a mapping a -> b, where a is a word in the cipher and b is a word in the word list. Then for the letter map, the letter at position i in a will map to the letter at position i in b.\nThis means certain word mappings are incompatible, for example the mappings\nxuq -> hit\nxil -> zip\nare incompatible, because \"x\" gets mapped to two different letters, which makes the decryption ambiguous.\n(Not needed for the statement: In this mapping, \"u\" and \"i\" also get mapped to the same letter, which makes encryption ambiguous. See below why I think this is a problem, even though the puzzle is still solvable.)\n\nI have also noticed that I am sometimes (test and validator 2, but I couldn't finish all tests in time, so there could be more) off by a really small amount of letters, and I think this is due to the fact that I am constructing my letter map in the wrong direction (from words in the word list to words in the cipher, i.e. the encryption map). The discrepancy would then be due to a mapping collision, where in my solution, the wrong letter gets the benefit. I think this means encrypting the message with the given word list would be ambiguous (= impossible), which would make it a less realistic test case. You can do with that info what you want, but if I'm right, you might want to generate a new test case, and make sure it is not ambiguous. If you do that, people will be able to choose in which way they construct their letter mapping without running into this problem.",

Here's what you have:\n\n      chars words register\nTC1   23       5          9\nTC2   136    21        29\nTC3   199     38       161\nTC4    156     24      212\nTC5     170    32       557\nTC6     143     18       556\nTC7     142     31       1070\nTC8      237    36       1081\n\nFor the most part, that all works for me, but again, I'd like to hear from other reviewers. Based on my puzzle history, I had a pretty good idea how I wanted to approach the problem. I didn't run into any issues along the way, so it all feels okay to me.\n\nHowever, just one suggestion. How about splitting up Test Case 1 and Validator 1? You could add a super easy and short Validator 1 and then you could add a more medium length test case to go along with your current Validator 1. The way you have things now, Validator 1 is a good bit more complex than Test Case 1.\n\nSuggested test case name changes: I like \"Title Case\" for test case names, just like you used in your puzzle title, but I do understand that is not an official Codingame standard. However, at least consider these minor wording changes:\n\nMore long message with more word -> Longer Message with More Words\nA lot more word -> A Lot More Words\n\nAgain, great job overall!",

    "content": "Very nice! I have some comments about test case flow for Mission 1. Then I will look at test case flow for Mission 2. I solved the puzzle, but I have a few question about the statement. \n\nWhat does it mean to say, \"he's only using words from the register\". Where did the register come from? I assume a register means an \"official list\" - I had to look that up by the way. Agent X left us the coded message. Is Agent X actually using the enemy's language or is the register a list of words in the language of Agent X? I didn't really get a sense of an \"enemy\" being involved other than possibly abducting Agent X.\n\nThese might just be goofy questions. The puzzle is definitely solvable without understanding these things and your overall concept is great, but I do wonder if some puzzlers might get confused and even hung up a bit on these concepts.\n\nI'm no linguist, so I'm open to comments from other reviewers!",

(this isn't the letter map this is a substitution table)\n(2) Yes but here you should solve this by yourself not just follow a given algorithm given so you need to find out a way of dooing it by yourself this is why this is medium difficulty and not easy.\n(3) Yes if a word is replaced by another it always be the same due to the substitution table. for example xup is hit. that mean that H is replaced by X, etc. Because of this this mean if hit apear twice it will be replaced again by xup. And yes word can appear twice for example \"I'm\" in test 2.\n(4) this seams ambiguous, I going to change that.\n(5) In this puzzle every letter is replaced by another it's only a permutation (I will add that too)\n(6) I thing i didn't get what is ambiguous in this example because there is only one solution to each input.",
