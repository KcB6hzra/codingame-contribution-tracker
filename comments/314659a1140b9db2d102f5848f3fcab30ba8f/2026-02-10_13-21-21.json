    "content": "I don't think this should be enabled for reverse mode. Unless someone has seen this exact problem before, trying to figure this out in reverse seems unlikely within 15 minutes. \nAlso, in reverse mode, CodinGame's bots can submit a previously played shortest mode solution. This happened in the clash I just played. Two bots submitted before human players, passing 100% of tests, because they submitted shortest mode solutions, since solving this problem is straightforward when you're given the statement.",
