    "content": "I really appreciate your feedback. Let me know your thoughts after I share the following:\n\n1) The puzzle has two keys that must be figured out for ultimate success - First, optimizing speed via some sort of Dynamic Programming. Second - thinking outside the box to come up with an overall approach to the problem that handles small test cases as well as large test cases.\n\n2) I didn't want to make the test cases so extreme, but to make the puzzle the same for all languages I had to do it. You might wonder what language caused me the problems, right? Believe it or not, it was Python.\n\nPython is given a very generous time limit for puzzles. By using numpy (which is written in C and C++), my first edition of this puzzle could be solved in Python by only addressing the first point above. By using numpy, you can get all the speed of C/C++, but still enjoy Python's generous time limit. As far as I know, all other languages would need to figure out both things above. I did code a solution in C and I could not solve the puzzle within the CG time limit for C if only #1 above was addressed.\n\nI  think (and I believe @Rafarafa agrees) the solution to this puzzle is really cool and wonderfully satisfying when you figure it out. Without the extreme cases, it is possible (I believe probable) for Python programmers to cut and past (with minor modifications) the numpy solution that works so elegantly on the original String Balls.\n\nSo...for the puzzle to exist and meet the design objectives in all languages, the extreme test cases must remain.",

Having just witnessed yesterday how many of my friends gave up on the AoC puzzle because it required dynamic programming makes me thing they are right.\n\n(And the first version of String Balls needed none of that. My published solution is some recursion with no cache whatsoever, and the tests were made with that in mind)\n\nAt least, I can speak for myself in that this version entailed a huge gap in difficulty compared to the first one, and that I would find odd them being assessed as \"equally difficult\" (even if I know that this is not what being in the same category means).\n\nEdit: But as you can tell, I'm usually wrong in these matters, and I will probably validate it anyway before the reset if no one else does.\n\nEdit2: it's @rafarafa, @rafa was taken so it became @rafa * 2",

    "content": "Well, Cylinders is a bit controversial... It can be brute-forced with fast languages, but my Python code needed more. It stays simpler (at least shorter) than what I did here, but unfortunately, as it was pointed out to me, it is incorrect (obviously without any test case exhibiting the problematic edge-case)...\nIn the discussion, I said :\n> And this goes some way into thinking that this is more of a Hard problem, when you need somewhat tricky optimizations to pass with slow languages.\n\nSo all in all, I'll stick with Hard for this one.\nAnd anyway, it is always somewhat subjective, so it seems normal to have quite a bit of fuzziness in the limit between difficulty levels.",

    "content": "It got validated, hurrah!\n\nI think the cylinder's one was easier to me. It seems to sit at 20% success rate so maybe there is an argument for it to be hard but oh well. It could have been luck, something could have clicked faster, I don't know. \n\nI also spent quite some time in the first verstion of this puzzle, plus the discussion that we had back then. I can't be objective.\n\nI think what @Lanfeust was refering is that the link in the statement:\n\nhttps://www.codingame.com/training/easy/string-balls\n\nwhile valid (since the puzzle was indeed validated easy), is not longer up to date and should be:\n\nhttps://www.codingame.com/training/medium/string-balls\n\nI will also add a link to part2 in the description of part1 tomorrow. I'm a bit tired now.\n\nEdit: since the links are trimmed by CG, I meant to replace \"easy\" with \"medium\" in the link.",
