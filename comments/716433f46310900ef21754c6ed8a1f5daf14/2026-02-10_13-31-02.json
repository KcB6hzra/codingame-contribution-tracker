Also, in tihs conditions, it is not for Reverse mode imo.\nGood job!",

I've played a lot of clashed and got some weird puzzles with about 10000 characters in the task description, i think this puzzle is a good one to have a smart puzzle where you need a bit more thinking of it to solve.\n\nIt's hard to respect all languages, when i think about ruby and shortcode, puzzles should also been balanced that the language itself given't you a handicap, but it's nearly impossible and we have to live with it.",

    "content": "\"The description says recursion is needed.\"\n- it's still a recursive operation at this point where you have to decode the result multiple times, if you use an loop for this, it's in your choice, loops and recursive calls do the same job, maybe i can remove this info, that some people not get confused when they think they have to write an recursive function for this\n\"if you add an extra test which only decodes to a single letter that would probably help a lot of people\"\n- i will take a look for this, thanks",
