    "content": "The only thing I really dislike about Python is that everyone programming in it seems to forget that almost all other languages has serious constraints on how large numbers can get. The last test uses 10^20 which is larger than 2^63 (even 2^64). This means if you are trying to do this CoC in C++, C#, Java (no one really goes for BigIntegers), just to mention the more popular languages, you literally have to invent your own string multiplication. I think you seriously need to reconsider the constraints on this one.",
