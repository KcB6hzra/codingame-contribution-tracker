Maybe you could add cases where the circuits are improperly designed and push the difficulty to medium. In case of an error the user has to output the wrong part, for example \" [ ( A [ B C ) ) ]\" would output \"short-circuit : [ B C )\", something like that.",

Also that isn’t really what a short circuit would imply but that’s not within the scope of the puzzle. I could add some tougher test cases and make it medium but I don’t really see much of a need to do so. This isn’t too complicated for easy IMO",

I get what it's like getting a good idea inspired by someone elses contribution and then being like \"damn, I can't really just make that, it'd be pretty obvious why im doing it\", go right ahead honestly. It'd be a completely different puzzle anyway. (I think?)",
