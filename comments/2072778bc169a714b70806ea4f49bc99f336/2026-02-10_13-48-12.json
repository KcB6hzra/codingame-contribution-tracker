    "content": "Good clash, but the test cases aren't hard enough to prepare clashers for Validator 5.\n\nI got this in Shortest mode and was tempted to save one character by just doing 9 repetitions of the bubble sort step and assuming it would be sorted by then, which worked for 100% of tests, but it fails for Validator 5. Doing 99 repetitions works and just costs 1 extra character, but it's good to have tests and validators of similar complexity. I recommend adding at least one test with around 20 books.",

    "content": "Good difficulty level for a clash: you have to understand Kendall tau distance, but you don't have to write a whole sort function.\n\nAs others have said, you need to include cases that test whether a program works all the way up to the specified constraints. Someone with a very slow program could pass all the tests, submit their code, and then fail the last validator which is significantly bigger than all the visible tests.\n\nName your tests (for example, \"only one book out of place\"). This lets programmers see which conditions their code is failing. And make sure the validators test the same things as the test cases.",

I don't like your solution of the problem tho, you're unnecessarly increasing the complexity by calculating the sorted(array) each time (if you want to do this like this you could remeber the value of sorted array after first calculation, it won't change). Maybe it would be cool to increase N and catch someone off guard with it if someone makes the same mistake. I would for sure aprreciate it but again I'm new (clashing for a week now).",

But looking at the test cases, it also doesn't seem to be checked, which makes it odd that this requirement exists :/\n\nAssuming there are no duplicates, this is a good contribution!",
