    "content": "I've got some feedback (most of it turns out to be spell-checking).\n\nFirst of all some questions about music, because I don't play string instruments.* I think many people who don't play them will be as confused as I am. Do E2, A2, D3, G3, B3, and E4 correspond to the snares of the guitar? If yes, how? What are frets? I don't know what you mean with the position on the neck of a guitar. Does that have to do with the frets and strings? And how do those things correspond to the frequency I get out of the instrument?\n\n* While I don't play them, I am slightly familiar with them, so I know the answers to the questions above. Other people might not though, so it's probably best if you add in some description in the goal statement. The ascii art below will probably help (it's probably not going to look good in this comment, because the text isn't monospace. You can make it monospace in your statement by putting it between backticks ( ` ). Additionally I'd add something about how the notes are ordered from A to G, and that after B3 comes C4 (this example might be wrong, I'm not familiar with this notation), and something about how going up one fret changes the tone by a half step.\n\nASCII art of the neck of a guitar:\n   21  20  19  18  17  16  15  14  13  12  11  10  9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- E2\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- A2\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- D3\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- G3\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- B3\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- E4\n\nGoal statement:\n* \"vis-versa\" -> \"vice versa\"\n* \"fret\" -> \"frets\" (twice)\n* \"also\" -> \"as well\"\n\nInput description:\n* I propose to describe line 1 more as follows: \"Either Guitar or Ukulele. Guitar if you need to convert from guitar to ukulele, Ukulele if otherwise.\"\n* \"position\" -> \"positions\"\n* \"interger\" -> \"integers\"\n* \"discribe\" -> \"describes\"\n* Split the last sentence into one about the strings and one about the frets for readability.\n\nOutput description:\n* \"integer\" -> \"integers\"\n* \"their\" -> \"there\"\n* It might be easier if the output was one line per pair and a space between the two numbers.",

But it is true that for someone who knows nothing about string instruments or worse, music, it can be very complex. I will therefore try to make an in-between (I take your ascii-art :) ).\n\nFor the output, since there can be several translations to do per test, I find it more logical that all the pairs corresponding to an input are on the same line even if it requires a little more formatting.",

Other than that, you're dong very well with English actually :)\n\nI see what you were going for with not including too much info on music. However, I think it will just frustrate a lot of people if they have to go look it up, especially if they can't find what they need. People are going to want to solve the puzzle. If that means brushing up on an algorithm you learned about 5 years ago, they're probably gonna do it. If it means learning the basics of a whole new theoretical subject, most people won't.\n\nI think you provided the right amount of info about music now. Much better. I would maybe consider leaving out everything about frequency, and how it's calculated, and instead only talk about notes. Maybe briefly mention that a note corresponds to the frequency of a sound (with higher notes corresponding to higher frequencies, if you feel like being fancy), and leave it at that.\nI think it's possible to include it in a clear way, but the text in its current form is a bit unclear in my opinion. You could try to leave out a bit of fluff for now. You can then work on adding some of it back in. Or do whatever :)\n\nFor the output, you're totally right, I glossed over the fact that sometimes you need to convert multiple positions.\n\nNow comes the result of an additional review round.\n\nThere are some small formatting-ish improvements you can make in the goal text, like putting 2^(1/12) between double curly brackets {{}} or putting n and n+1 between double brackets [[]]. These strings appear in the third paragraph. I don't know what the conventions are for these formatting types.\n\nWriting \"string=0 represents ...\" doesn't look very nice to me, Maybe a bit better would be \"If string is 0, it corresponds to ...\". After the parentheses, I'd add \", and\" in that sentence.\n\nIn the output, make sure people know \"Each line is a list of pairs ...\". I could see some confusion arise when people assume the n lines are one big list, instead of every line being a list on its own. That was the mistake I made earlier, when I challenged your output format.\n\nLast but not least: \"and pairs a separated by a space\" -> \"and pairs are separated by a space\".\n\nI'm going to take a stab at solving the thing now :)\n\nEdit: hmm, the ascii art doesn't fit in the small space provided on the left in the IDE. might be best to replace every three dashes with two dashes.\nAdditionally (forgot to say this earlier), I don't agree with your choice to put line breaks between every line of the thing. I think it looks better without those.",
