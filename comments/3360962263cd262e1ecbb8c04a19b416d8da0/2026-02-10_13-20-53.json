    "content": "Hey, when I had this in a Clash, I understood from the assigment that we need AT LEAST 10% more bricks\n\nFor your first example, you would require at least:\n3 * 6 * 1.1 = 19.8 -> 20 full bricks\n6 * 1.1 = 6.6 -> 7 half bricks\nTherefore, the result would be 20 * 3 + 7 * 2 = 74, instead of 19.8*3 + 6.6*2 = 59.4 + 13.2 = 72.6 floored to 72\n\nAny way you choose, I think it would be better to specify what operation (round, floor, ceil) you expect on the result",

    "content": "Thanks for your proposal, it is very interesting. Here are my comments: \n- Despite the fact that it is the problem which is more mathematical than programmatic, I think there is one information which is missing, it is the fact that the price should be \"floored\" and not \"rounded\" nor \"ceilled\". \n- Also the validators should be similar (but not exactly the same) as the test they follow. In other words, if in the test 4 you test the validity with high numbers, in the validator 4 you should tests diffents number but equally high.\n- To finish, I would advise you to change the first test for something even simpler, that could be calculated in head in order to ease the thinking of  the algorithm. for instance: \"2 4 2 1\" So it is easier to calculate 2x4x2 = 16; 16 + 8x1 = 24 + 10% = 26. \n- Just a personal thought at last, maybe it would be good also to mention the 10% margin a second time, one could easily forget it, as it is mentioned only once, at the begin.\n\nI am no expert, so if anyone want to share their thought about those recommendation, please do.",
