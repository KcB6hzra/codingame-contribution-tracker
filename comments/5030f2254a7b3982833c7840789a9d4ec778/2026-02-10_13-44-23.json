My only thought is that for reverse mode, the outputs could maybe be a little more clear, for example, (\"Known Contact!\" and \"Weirdo Stalker!\") or (\"Known Weirdo Stalker!\" and \"Unknown Weirdo Stalker!\") or (\"You Know This Weirdo Stalker!\" and \"You Don't Know This Weirdo Stalker!\") Nothing too major and can still be figured out as is, however, I personally find it a little odd the way it is phrased.",
