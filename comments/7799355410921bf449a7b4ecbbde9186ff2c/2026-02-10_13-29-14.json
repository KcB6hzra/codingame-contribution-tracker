    "content": "This is a personal opinion but you seem to take these well.\n\nThis puzzle is no way an easy one. \"Researching online what a Markov chain is, what an n-gram is, and how to apply this to text is part of your quest.\" <- This sentence alone indicates how much it is not the case, An easy task -- in my opinion -- is a good stepping stone for beginners, i.e it should not involve extensive search to understand the task plus possible search for programming constructs (I think most people solve this with some sort of dictionary construct). And while both skills are important they are not easy.\n\nAlso having example for word_count(seed) > depth is an edge case that is not trivial to notice why it fails.\n\nAnd I do understand the number of lines to code this is rather low and with enough experience the given example is sufficient to know what to do but that's not a reason to make this easy. There is a Hard problem here in CG for which I constructed a closed formula in 5 minutes that solved it. Does that make it easy? No, I have a PhD in Mathematics and saw similar tasks many times. People tend to forget in the comment section that pre-existing knowledge makes things look easy. And I too, like others solved this in less than 10 minutes with ease and quite liked all the concepts but difficulty should not be based on that.\n\nAnd to finish it off, it is a great puzzle, I really liked it, especially how rare these days seem to be to have a well-written description.",

This certainly does not need anything as complicated as recursion or a constraint solver or search like DFS.\n\nMy rules of thumb for difficulty is as follows : \n* if/else and possibly a loop is 'easy'.  \n* Recursion, DFS, BFS, Minimax is 'medium'.  \n* Tricky or mathy stuff with multiple steps is 'hard' or 'very hard'",
