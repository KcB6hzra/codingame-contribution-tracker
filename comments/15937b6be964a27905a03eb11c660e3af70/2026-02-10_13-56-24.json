    "content": "This could be interesting, but the way the subject is currently worded does make it a bit offputting.\n\nImprovement suggestions:\n- Replace the first paragraph with an actual introduction to the problem. An elaborate \"This is an implementation of castle siege\".\n- This entails: drop the tedious variable description entirely from the subject section: the're better fit for the inputs section.\n- Either move the tower's choosing criteria in the round 1 description, or add a \"using algorithm below\" placeholder.\n- tower priority uses the word \"closest\". This would need detail (Manhattan? Max? Euclid distance?)\n- the clause that 0-HP units are valid targets makes things more complicated than necessary. If I read the rules properly, this can only happen during the first round anyway, so it's probably best to just drop that.\n- enemies can be targetted by multiple towers. A note confirming it's legit and reminding HP decreases accordingly would be appreciated.",
