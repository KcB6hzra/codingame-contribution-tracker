Please revise as follows:\n\nYou are given [[x]] and [[y]], where [[x]] represents the number of objects to select from a set of [[y]] distinct objects. You must output the number of permutations, using this formula: [[y]]! / ([[y]] - [[x]])! .\n\nInput\n* There are two lines, not one. Please rewrite as follows:\n\n<<Line 1>>: An integer [[x]] for the number of objects to select\n<<Line 2>>: An integer [[y]] for the total number of objects\n\nOutput\n* Please change \"that the permutation results to\" to \"of permutations\".\n\nConstraints\n* Please format all instances of \"x\" and \"y\" as [[variables]].\n\nGame modes\n* Suggest to disable Reverse mode.\n\nThanks.",
