I predict the mode score in a typical clash will be 0%.  \n\nTry explaining that you want the greatest difference between the ASCII codes of any two *letters* in the sentence.  That's what your code is doing.   With that change, this this might be okay for a \"fastest\" clash (pretty easy, especially in languages with built-in max and min operations), but is a bit more interesting in \"shortest\" mode as a golf problem.  \n\nYou still have the same words in validators as you do in the corresponding tests.  That makes the validator answers the same as the open test cases, and makes the problem vulnerable to \"hard coding\".\n\nWhen @snoyes said \"similar to, but different than\", he meant that the validator should probe the same edge/corner cases as the test, but with different values so the solver can't guess from the open Input/Output pairs what the hidden validator Input or Output values are.\n\n<annoying-spelling-cop-mode>\nAnd I think the word you're looking for in Test 3 is \"leisure\".  \n</annoying-spelling-cop-mode>",
