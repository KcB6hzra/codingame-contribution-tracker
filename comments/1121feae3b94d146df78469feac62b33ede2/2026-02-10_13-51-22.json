    "content": "It seems a very nice puzzle for a CoC.  Just few comments.\n\nThe Line1 input is always ordered? They are in the examples but the description doesn't say it. If the order is guaranteed, the puzzle it's (slightly) simpler.\n\nI believe it would be clearer to add the € symbol to the description:\n\"we use 1€ e 2€ coins, and 5€ .... \"\n\nAlso, I was confused by the word \"clipping\" I don't think is a common word (I'm not a native English speaker, so may just be me) and could slow down the CoC participant.\nSomething like \"denomination of notes/coins\", or even the simpler \"types of notes/coins\".",
