    "content": "Hello,\nThanks for the feedback.\n\nThis contribution was inspired by the Codewars problem you linked. I thought it would be a fun little clash as I had done it on Codewars before. If you think it's too \"unoriginal,\" I can always add my twist to it.\n\nAs for the solution, I didn't write it using AI, as you claim I did. I'm a Java addict; I do all my work using Java, so I'm used to making functions for everything. If you go back to the previous versions of this contribution, you will see that the solution was written in Java. However, I changed it to Python because Java is pretty slow at running the test cases. If you want me to provide the solution in the same format as the code generated by the stub generator, I'm more than happy to do so.\n\nI hope this cleared things up, and thanks again for the feedback ;)",

    "content": "Thanks for clarifying. I appreciate your response. If you're comfortable with Python and you've made the necessary adjustments to the solution, there's no need to provide it in the same format as the code generated by the stub generator. However, adding a little twist of your own to the code can make it more unique and showcase your creativity. It's always great to bring your own personal touch to the solutions. Keep up the good work!",

    "content": "Thank you but it seems some of the changes have not been made?\n\nConstraints\n* Instead of deleting the constraint on [[num]], you may just define [[num]] in Input section.\n\n* The ranges issue has not been fixed. In case you don't understand, what I mean is that you have 1 <= n <= 10⁴, but the maximum n among all the cases is just 10, way below 10⁴.\n\nSimilar situation for num.\n\nCases\n* As mentioned, each pair of test and validator should be similar but different. That means,\n• Simple 1 (test) should be similar to Simple 1 (validator) but not the same.\n• Simple 2 (test) should be similar to Simple 2 (validator) but not the same.\nand so on and so forth.\n\nThanks again.",
