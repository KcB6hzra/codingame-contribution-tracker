    "content": "Good reverse puzzle, and good formatting.\n\nHowever, your validators don't match their associated tests. For example, your first example has a space inside, but its validator is just a single world. Another example: Test 7 has a non-alphanumeric symbol in it, but its validator doesn't. \nAs a reminder, validators are not meant to add more test cases (they're hidden after all), but mainly to prevent hardcoding.\n(By the way, Validator 7 is named \"This should give it away\", but since validators are hidden in actual play, players will never see this.)\n\nAnother thing, I don't think N is necessary for this puzzle; maybe there are languages that would require it to parse a string, but I can't think of any on the top of my head; if I'm wrong, please correct me.\n\nThat said, I like this, fun to code a solution for it too.",

    "content": "Hello Linkyu\nThanks for the feedback. To be honest i didn't really understand the difference between a test and a validator. I just saw them as different test cases. \n\nI could switch validator 1 (ie test 2)  with test 3 and throw in a non-alpha into the validator. \n\nAs far for the n necessary or not I agree but just because I couldn't think of a language that needs it doesn't mean it doesn't exist so I threw it in there for safety. \n\nThanks",

If the coder can't work out the method, they might hardcode 'if input = 1, output = 2' to pass the test, but that would fail the validation, and they couldn't hardcode anything to pass the validation because they never see it.",
