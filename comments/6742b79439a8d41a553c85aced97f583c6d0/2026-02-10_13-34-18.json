    "content": "That would make sense if there was a clear strategy for tagging, but the current tags are fairly arbitrary and not clearly defined or delineated. \"Nested loops\" isn't official and doesn't show up as a tag for this puzzle, but I contend that it should. In fact, there should be a lot more puzzles with this tag. If anything, \"Loops\" should be removed and reserved for simpler puzzles. I had only tagged this puzzle \"Loops\" because \"Nested loops\" wasn't an option. Tagging is something I hoped to be able to tackle upon reaching level 29. You can imagine my disappointment. If it's a lost cause, why wouldn't I just as well remove all tags from my puzzles? Sorry for the pessimism. If you still feel there's a good reason, then sure.",
