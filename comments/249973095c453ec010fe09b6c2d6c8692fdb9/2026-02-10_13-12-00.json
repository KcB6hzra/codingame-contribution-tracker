You are right that this is not clear, so I updated the input section. This constraint is just an indication of the complexity of the problem.\n\nThe remark you raise about line 31 is very clever, works indeed, but seems to be the result of a bunch of logic mixed together that is not easy to see. I won't change it because I find it easier to think about it how I wrote it, but that was a very nice suggestion (Note that the comment at line 37 is no longer true if I do what you say, but that shows that it wasn't totally needed either).\n\nYour solution is great, I was messing around a bit with it, and this is what I got:\n\nhttps://bpa.st/63UUS\n\nUltimately you are right, this is more an easy puzzle than I clash.
