Some redundancy in the statement and contraints but it's clear enough to understand on first read.  \n\nI'd love to show you my C# code, I think you'd learn a thing or two about .Net and C# that would make future solutions a lot simpler. I did it in 17 lines.",

    "content": "A few points I noticed and suggestions:\n\nPerhaps Tic-Tac-Toe reads slightly easier to read than TicTacToe?\n\nIs there a reason for the empty {{ }} in the second sentence? \"You are also given the state of a TicTacToe game, where {{ }} (space) means...\" - If you're trying to use space as a constant, it doesn't appear, just having (space) is fine I think.\n\nThird sentence has: \"The winning path must be 'at least' [[g]] cells long\" but the constraint and results are exactly [[g]] spaces. - I suppose technically it's correct but might be worth just changing to exactly [[g]] for consistency.\n\nConsider changing the list of winning paths to be bullet points for easier reading, e.g.\nThe winning path will be represented using the characters:\n• {{-}} (if the winning path is in a row)\n• {{|}} (if the winning path is ... etc.\n\n(Note: these are just suggestions - feel free to disregard if you disagree)",
