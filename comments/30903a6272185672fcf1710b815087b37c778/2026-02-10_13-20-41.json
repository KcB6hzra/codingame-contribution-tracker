In the example, the lead zombie is on the 2nd tile and the other zombie is 0.14 tiles behind that. Neither are on the 1st tile, so why do they die?\n\nIn truth, any zombie that is <= 2 tiles away will be killed, according to the tests and solution. So it seems like the squash kills all the zombies on tiles 1 or 2 (1x2 area). It would be good to make all of this clear in the statement, because currently it doesn't explain it well and clashers have to solve the problem based on the tests instead of the statement.",
