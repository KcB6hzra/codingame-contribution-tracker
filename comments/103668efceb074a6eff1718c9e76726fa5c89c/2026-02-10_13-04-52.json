I just had this clash and figured out the pattern is \"maximum size of a group when grouping the words by their length\" (code below) which works for all the visible tests, but then failed 50% of the validators. If you only have 3 different outputs (1, 2, 3) there are always going to be countless different ways to get to the same numbers with only 4 tests.\n\nprint(max(Counter(len(word) for word in input().split()).values()))",

Over 1% ((1/3)^4) of attempts will pass the tests even if you mindlessly try COMPLETELY random patterns that produce output from 1 to 3. If you use just a little bit of brainpower that chance goes up by a lot. Three different distinct outputs is simply not enough for a reverse mode.",
