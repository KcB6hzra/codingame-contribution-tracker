    "content": "❌ Rejected the contribution.\nComment: * The statement is ambiguous about how the filtering operation should be applied. For example, one interpretation consistent with the wording is to process indices sequentially from the end:\n  • Pair N and N - 1 and eliminate N\n  • Pair N - 1 and N - 2 and eliminate N - 1\n  • Pair N - 2 and N - 3 and eliminate N - 2\nand so on. Under this interpretation, the answer is always 1.\n\n* Since the result can be obtained by a direct calculation, it currently lacks any key programming elements such as lists, sets, dictionaries, string manipulation, loops, or conditions.",

    "content": "Quick logic puzzle! suits well for shortest/reverse mode. But I'd suggest specifying that the pairs are disjoint (1-2, 3-4...), as the current wording could be interpreted as a domino effect (Luckily, the example clears up the ambiguity).",
