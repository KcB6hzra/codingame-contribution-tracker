Feel free to ask for further clarification if you still have questions.\nContext: My original comment was talking about the quality of the contributed puzzle.\n1) \"Good that test case require unambiguous integer answers.\"  Automated tests are different than human judgement in that they do not provide feedback on the quality of the solution, only pass/fail.  As such they should be clear and avoid frustrating \"near miss\" answers.  Integer answers are clear like that.  The problem with floating point is that rounding errors can make a solution that works in one language fail in another. You can google more on the perils of floating point comparisons.\n2) \"The scenario in the description is very fitting for the problem as well as showing creativity.\"  The puzzle scenario provides a justification for the calculation needed to solve the test cases.  That makes the scenario \"fitting\" rather than \"arbitrary\" or \"bizarre\".  The puzzle also has a nice \"flavor text\" that brings some fun and creativity instead of just asking for the calculated result. I found it to be pleasant.",
