    "content": "With reference to the forum comment here ( https://forum.codingame.com/t/community-puzzle-haunted-manor/1421/33 ):\n\n> What is actually given is the number of times we see monsters, not how many monsters we see.\n\nI'd like to suggest you to amend the wording in both Goal section and Input section to avoid potential confusion. Currently, the phrasing might lead readers to interpret it as the total number of monsters visible, rather than the total number of times monsters appear in view (whether directly or in a mirror). As pointed out in the same comment, the distinction is important.\n\nIn addition, it'll be helpful to make the distinction even clearer by adding an explanation in Goal section, similar to the one provided here ( https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/doc/undead.html#undead ):\n\n> If your reflected line of sight crosses the same monster more than once, the number will count it each time it is visible, not just once.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "Nice puzzle : )\n\nProblem : There is an Inconsistency between constraints and test cases...\n\n    Constraint :  3 ≤ size ≤ 7\n    Cases : \"Not much of a manor\" (both Test and Validator) are of size < 3\n\nProblem : Possible missing information?\n\n    - Problem Statement doesn't say that there is always 1 (and only 1) solution\n    - It also doesn't tell you how to choose between two possible solutions.\n\n    I believe that that the statement should normally say one of these two things.  If there\n    is only 1 possible solution, say so ... if there might be more than one, you need to\n    indicate which solution to return (example: 'the one that comes first, alphabetically')\n\nVery minor issues, but  they should probably be addressed : )",
