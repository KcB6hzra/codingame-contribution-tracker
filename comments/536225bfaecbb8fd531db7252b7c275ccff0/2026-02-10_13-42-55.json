With that said, I had absolutely no idea how to debug this without looking at your code, although Iove reverse puzzles. I think what threw me off the most is that both \"E\" and \"F\" are represented twice. That's so unusual concept that I find it very hard to imagine most of the players will find this out.\n\nMy main concern is that 6 of 8 players will not be able to solve this at all which means 6 of 8 people just got frustrated after this one. To be honest, even if I could solve a CoC like this, I am very frustrated (regardless of winning or not).\n\nAlthough I must say, I like your solution a lot. Very nice.",

All I'm saying is the fact that if E and F are double represented than this one is already much harder than most of the CoCs.
