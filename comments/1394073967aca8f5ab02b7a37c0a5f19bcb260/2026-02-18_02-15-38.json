    "content": "Rules\n* Please specify whether each round is independent, and whether opponents' previous moves (provided as input) are for reference only (e.g. to allow the player compute the score since no score is given as input) and have no effect on the current round.\n\nElimination\n* Please refer to the page below as a reference:\n\nhttps://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/git-patchwork\n\nReview the HTML code of the sections \"Victory Conditions\" and \"Defeat Conditions\", then:\n\n  • Add a similar \"Victory Conditions\" section for your game.\n\n  • Replace \"Elimination\" with \"Defeat Conditions\".\n\n* Please change \"format (each line must be \"opponent_id move\")\" to \"output format\".\n\n* Please replace \"'C' or 'D'\" with \"<const>C</const> or <const>D</const>\" (without any quotation marks).\n\nExample\n* Please begin \"Turn 1 Input\" in a separate paragraph.\n\n* Consider formatting inputs and outputs (e.g. \"0 2\", \"1 C 2 C\") using <const> tags for clarity.\n\nInput, Output, Constraints\n* Please refer to the HTML code of the above-referenced page to format these sections properly (e.g. by adding <div class=\"statement-section statement-protocol\">).\n\n* Please remove all single quotation marks around the characters C, D and N.\n\n* The variable \"turns\" is undefined. Please replace \"<var>turns</var>\" with \"Maximum number of turns\".\n\nReferee\n* The referee appears to crash whenever the output is invalid (e.g. \"1\", or \"0 D\" when I'm player 0). Please fix the issue.\n\nThanks.",
