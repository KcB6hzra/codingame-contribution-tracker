    "content": "The game looks much improved now!\n\nRules\n* Please specify whether each round is independent, and whether opponents' previous moves (provided as input) are for reference only (e.g. to allow the player to compute the score since no score is given as input) and have no effect on the current round.\n\nVictory Conditions\n* Consider reordering the conditions, and rewriting the earlier possible victory condition as follows:\n\n  • If at any point only one player remains active, that player wins and the game ends immediately.\n\nDefeat Conditions\n* Please change \"format (each line must be \"opponent_id move\")\" to \"output format\". If you want to keep the original wording, please format \"opponent_id\" and \"move\" using the <var> tag.\n\nInput for one game turn\n* [[move]] is not an integer. Please change \"integers\" to \"values\" and then add \"(integer)\" after \"ID\".\n\nViewer\n* Consider increasing the font size.\n\n**********\n\nI don't think I've ever seen an 8-player bot game here before. My guess is that this configuration might be causing issues with the last-battle UI, which normally supports up to 4 players.\n\nAs a quick test, I submitted a bot that outputs C for every opponent, and the ranking appeared to get stuck (you can check the leaderboard). By contrast, I submitted a bot that outputs random on every turn in \"Animal Chess\" ( https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5509706f8b0072d4f52b280f2ac7ba29f0ca7 ), and the last-battle UI popped up and displayed 10 games that all started and finished correctly. You're welcome to try this yourself.\n\nThat said, I'm not certain about the exact cause of the issue. While the 8-player setup seems like a likely explanation, it could also be something else.\n\n(I'm aware that the SDK documentation states the maximum number of players is 8, but…)\n\nThanks.",
