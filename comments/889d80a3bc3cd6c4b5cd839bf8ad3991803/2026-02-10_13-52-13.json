    "content": "After rethinking the puzzle many times people will soon discover this feature about the 'order'. Having the 'order' concept can help explaining the puzzle and provide a starting point to code a trial solution to experiment with. I did think about making tricks on the starting and ending indexes but finally dropped the idea. Adding new validations on indexes I have to add similar test cases. It will make the puzzle look more complex than it should be and divert focus on minor issues. I believe when a sophisticated solution is done such tricks will naturally become no more challenge.",
