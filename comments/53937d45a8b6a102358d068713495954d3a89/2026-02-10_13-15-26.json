    "content": "Thanks for your reply! I don't understand your 100ml-199ml outlier remark; the constraints are 200-1000, so indeed there is no case with 100-199.\n\nAs for reverse; I can remove that mode, but I do not agree right away with your comment, so let me state my opinion once. The space/no space and 200-1000 issue is something that fastest and shortest players need because they do not know what cases will be coming - but reverse players can simply see all the cases and find out that it is sometimes with and sometimes without space, and that all answers of the cases are between 200 and 1000. I've made sure that all validators are well between those boundaries (more than the test cases), so that a player does not get annoyingly surprised after submission.",

I think it would be nice if you make a test case that specifically shows the spaced ml and one specifically for the 200-1000 range.\n\nEx.\n\n\"Ingredients: Blah blah 500 ml and also 300 L of uh water\"\n\n\"Ingredients: 100ml is not correct but 200ml is\"\n\n\nAlso this is a unrelated comment but fastest and shortest players can see all the test cases that the reverse players can.

    "content": "Ah, I now see your point about the ml case - I had totally overlooked that for the reverse player finding the value with 'ml' is not obvious. Instead of adding a test case that tries to explain this, I have altered the output request to [[volume]] {{ml}}.\n\nAs for the 200-1000 case, I did add an additional testcase with also values 150 and 180 in it. But I hesitated to put 150 ml in it, because then the border of 200 ml becomes more prominent, which is for reverse players quite arbitrary. And that is probably exactly what you meant as well. Let me think about it for a day - maybe I will remove reverse after all, and then indeed include a <200 ml edge case.\n\nThanks for taking your time to think along!",
