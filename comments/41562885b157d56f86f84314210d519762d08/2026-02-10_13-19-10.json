Something that I might add to the description would be: \"Assume that there is ALWAYS one solution on each case\". So that clashers don't need to consume time thinking on edge cases where there are not three integers whose sum is 0",

In my opinion this should usually be done when parsing is not the main focus of a clash.\n\nThanks.",
