    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: This puzzle is really fun and original. I like how you introduced a story background.\n\nI accept it as is, but if I had to make a comment I would try to clarify the rules. I think it would be clearer if you'd highlight the sentence \"No character can be on the end of the bridge\". Also, precise this is only for the fellowship, but Gandalf and the Balrog can. Finally, maybe you can precise that you can break the bridge even if people stand on it, while they are on the right side\n\nVery good contribution !",

So, keeping this silly assumption means you get a silly conclusion - by breaking the bridge, everyone is \"trapped inside Moria.\" :P",
