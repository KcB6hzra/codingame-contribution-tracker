    "content": "I stumbled a bit reading the goal out from top down. That may be fully my fault, but I think I know what was throwing me off. \n\nReading the stub in JS, the array becomes \"inputs\" instead of \"A\". This led to a bit of variable confusion, as I wasn't seeing \"A\" in the stub after reading \"A[i]\" in the second sentence.\nThis may not be the proper way to format it, but my suggestion for this would be to add something along the lines of \"Given an array of house locations [[A]], for [[N]] houses\" prior to mentioning [[A]][i]. This, or just generally some way of describing what [[A]] is, prior to mentioning it (or at the same time you're mentioning it).",

    "content": "Nice clash idea.\n\nI think you need some more tests/validators though.\n\nA naive solution I had tried at first passed all the tests, but failed Validator 2. So I would have gotten 100% in-clash, then only 75% after I submitted, giving me no chance to debug if it were a real clash.\n\nInput\n20 3\n0 2 18\nWorking Out:\ndistances = [2, 4, 2]\nmax_distance = 4\nmin_walk = 16\n\nMy issue was that to calculate the 'distances' between points, I was allowing the distance to always be the shortest distance possible, rather than simply taking the clockwise distance, so when I found the distance from 2->18 I said it was 4 (2,1,0,19,18) instead of 16 (2,3,...,17,18). This leads to the wrong answer.\n\nIt would be good to add at least one test case that has this issue. Basically you need a gap between two houses that is greater than half the perimeter. That will reproduce this issue and allow clashers to debug it in-clash if their code suffers from this mistake.",
