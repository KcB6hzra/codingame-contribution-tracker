If you add a note explaining this or even just brackets (+) and (-) next to those words, then I can approve.",

    "content": "Some remarks:\n- Currently there is only a 'nonsense' in one test (test 5), but not in the validators. Reverse players that submit code with only 'attracts' and 'repels' based on the first four tests will not be punished.\n- Actually, your test 5 requires output 'nonsense', but the option of output 'nonsense' is not described anywhere.\n-Your constraints are incorrect. It states only + and - is given, but test 5 gives other characters.\n- Usually, the statement itself already contains the task description. With this contribution, reading the statement is 'a waste of my time'. I suggest rephrasing to something like \"...either positive ({{+}}) or negative ({{-}}). Create a piece of code that deciphers the effect of the interaction, which can be one of {{attracts}} when different charges are present, {{repels}} when all charges are the same, or {{nonsense}} if the effect output contains other characters.\"",

Currently there are only two possible answers in this clash (\"attracts\" / \"repels\"), hence it suffers from a binary output issue. Please revise the output requirement so that there are more than 2 possible answers in total.\n\nGoal\n* Please add \"{{+}}\" after \"positive\". (Note that {{ }} is the syntax for constants.)\n\n* Please add \"{{-}}\" after \"negative\".\n\nInput\n* Next N lines: Please delete \"separated by commas\". You haven't put any commas in the input.\n\nOutput\n* Please format \"attacts\" and \"repels\" as {{constants}} and remove the quotation marks.\n\nThanks.",
