Maybe 123456 could always be the first password.\nThis will not denature the puzzle and it will help people new to xor with debugging. Plus the puzzle will be solvable without keeping everything in memory.",

I don't believe checking if encrypted_passwords includes a value introduces too much difficulty versus only checking against encrypted_passwords[0]. But I understand thinking the clash overall is too difficult, so I'd like to receive more feedback from others to gather sentiment about the difficulty to determine if it's acceptable. For anyone reading this contribution, please test this clash in the IDE and check how long it takes you to solve this problem on your own before approving it.",
