    "content": "Little confusing to understand when \"distance squared\" is mentioned, Maybe specifying the need to round to nearest integer would clear that up.\nAlso in output it would be clean if the sequence changes to something like \"Neighbour if the distance is less than or equal to 1\nHe can if the square of distance rounded to nearest integer is even\nHe can't otherwise\"\nAnyway , I tried it in Java and it is a fun clash, Keep adding more :)",

    "content": "Binary output issue\n* According to the contribution guidelines, binary outputs should be avoided for clashes. That's exactly the issue with your clash, as it allows only two possible answers (either \"True\" or \"False\"). Please modify the output requirement to allow for more than two possible answers.\n\nFormatting\n* Please study the formatting syntax on this page: https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/statement , and format your statement properly.\n\nGoal\n* Please format \"x\" and \"y\" as [[variables]] (separately, excluding the comma between them).\n\nInput\n* Please rewrite the input description following the example provided in the link above. Since x and y are given in separate lines, describe them separately.\n\n* Also note that the correct spelling is \"integer\" instead of \"interger\".\n\nConstraints\n* Please specify the lower and upper bounds for x and y.\n\nCases\n* Each test and its validator should cover the same scenario with slightly different inputs. No two cases should be identical. Please update the cases accordingly.\n\nThanks.",

For example, you may refer to: https://www.maartengrootendorst.com/blog/distances/\n\n* Please format \"x\" and \"y\" as [[variables]].\n\n* The output requirement hasn't been updated.\n\nInput\n* Please follow the example in the link provided in my previous comment. x and y are on TWO separate lines, and the current description should reflect that.\n\nOutput\n* The word \"And\" seems to imply that \"Neighbour\" should be output when applicable *in addition to* \"He can\"/\"He can't\". Please clarify the wording as that's not the intended meaning.\n\nCases\n* x = 0 in most cases. Please modify the cases so that x is positive in some cases, negative in some cases, and 0 in at most one pair of cases.\n\n* Please revise one visible test so that y is negative in that case.\n\nThanks.",
