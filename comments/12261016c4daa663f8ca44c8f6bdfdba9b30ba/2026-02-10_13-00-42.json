    "content": "great puzzle, bit hard to understand the meaning at first but in the end i got it, i had an issue with some of the test cases where i had to specify that if the base angle was more than 360* and was an multiple of 360 that i had to subtract 1 from the total number, and also if the base angle started negative i also had to subtract 1 from the total number, i believe this is due to my lack of coding experience since the test data outputs match up with the actual result.  Overall great puzzle and i will approve it",

    "content": "The sentence \"An angle is coterminal with D if you can add or subtract 360° from it any number of times\" doesn't explain what you mean (you can _always_ add or subtract 360 from any number).\nI'd suggest instead something like: \"two angles are coterminal if their difference is a multiple of 360°\".\nOnce fixed, I'd approve it.",

Please vary the cases a bit to require a wider range of answers.\n\n* Additionally, include some some test angles of less than -999 degrees (e.g. -1000, -2647, -3600) in **both** tests and validators. This may be done as part of the test case adjustments mentioned above.\n\nThanks.",
