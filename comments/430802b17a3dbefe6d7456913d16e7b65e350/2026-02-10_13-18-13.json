    "content": "No constraints? I'm surprised! Is it because the problem won't get that offered since it is a Reverse mode clash? I was expecting at least one constraint that the height will be 2 or more and width will be at least that of maximum characters on firstString and secondString (for the contents to fit into the box as per alignment). \n\nThis problem seems well for fastest mode as well, along with Reverse that you've already suggested. Why not have it for both of these modes?\n\nAnother cool problem, I like the simplicity of your idea(s) and a good and clear solution that it desires.",

If I have to explain that, then they don't have to figure it out :)",

If the input can fit exactly in a grid that size, then it's “just right\".  If too big or too small for the grid, then it's the other options  :)",
