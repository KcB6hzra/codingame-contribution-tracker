    "content": "Nice clash.\n\nOne current issue with it is that [[N]] is not a prime for 13/14 tests+validators, the only time [[N]] is prime is Test \"Not Found\" where it is 5. This means that in Shortest mode, you can simply treat [[N]] as part of the list of integers and since none of the validators have a prime [[N]] then it will never affect the result in those. So if you're sneaky, you can save a few characters this way.\nIt's not a big deal, but it's one of the reasons why its good to have tests and validators be the same size as each other.",

That's possible because of your constraint 1<=num<=1000, but if the numbers get bigger, this will take too much time to compute.\n;)",
