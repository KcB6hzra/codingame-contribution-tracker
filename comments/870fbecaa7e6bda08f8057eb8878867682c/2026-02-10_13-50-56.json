Let me clarify my last comment; I mean this contribution can be reclassified as a clash of code, or it can remain as a community puzzle.\n\nThe current CoC system is supposedly a secret system (https://forum.codingame.com/t/faq-really-frequently-asked-questions/409/52). Having the same contribution in both CoC and community puzzle categories would break that system (or make the system more broken than it already is).",
