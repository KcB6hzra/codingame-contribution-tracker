    "content": "Thanks for the feedback @Hall_Alexandra! Indeed, I have thought about making this a puzzle, but that would make this problem exponentially harder. It would require a clear definition of statement types and culprit behaviour, and would most likely require (at least) one culprit for statements to be logically deducible. I'm not sure I entirely agree with the culprit being labelled based on the one claimed to have been seen the most, as you suggest.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the current clash? Based on your suggestion, I assume that you did manage to deduce the logic, perhaps after some time of thinking. Do you think this clash is doable within 5 minutes, or maybe 10 minutes?",
