I am convinced that it is not an easy puzzle but rather medium.\n\nI tested 24 possible permutations (factorial 4),\n4 possible operations give 4^3 = 64 results,\nIf you consider associations using parenthesis you have to multiply everything by 3.\n\nTotal : 24 * 64 * 3 = 4608 results from 4 numbers.\nThere may be redundancies however. I needed 182 lines of Java code to reach a result (print included). I need to refactor a bit but I don't think i can do much better.\n\nCongratulations for your challenge, I hope it will be validated.\n\nHere is my output below :\n/*\nCombi : 12 12 9 13\nIntermediaires  1.33 10.67\nResultat correct : 23.67\n\nCombi : 12 13 9 12\nIntermediaires  25.0 0.75\nResultat correct : 24.25\n\nCombi : 13 9 12 12\nIntermediaires  0.75 12.25\nResultat correct : 24.25\n*/",
