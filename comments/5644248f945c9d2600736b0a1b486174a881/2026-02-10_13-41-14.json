I do think someone with their wits about them could solve this in reverse mode, but probably there are people on this site who don't even know what T9 is, and they might have a very hard time with it. Still, I think the test cases make it possible to infer what's going on, so whether to keep it eligible for reverse mode is entirely your discretion.",
