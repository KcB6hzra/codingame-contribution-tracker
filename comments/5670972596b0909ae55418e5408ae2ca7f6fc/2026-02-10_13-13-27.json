    "content": "❌ Rejected the contribution.\nComment: The problem description is unclear. \"They have the option to take a break\" implies that each contestant can choose to take a break or to complete the entire race without doing so. Therefore, the finishing order will depend on whether or not the contestants take their break. However, the rest of the problem assumes every contestant takes a break. See @sayankhanmidnapore and @jddingemanse's comments. @Bingbing and @JohnG.A's comments also apply. The wording has changed since the writing of their comments, but the core issue persists.",

Two small suggestions:\n- In your statement you discuss t first and then s - it helps if then in the input it is also t first and then s;\n- 'They have the option to take a break' is confusing: suggestion to rephrase to 'They take a break of t minutes during the race'. (yes, maybe it is a break of 0 minutes ergo no break, but still they will take that one, it's not optional)",
