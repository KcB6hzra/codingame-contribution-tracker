I can fix them by using trim function, but those codes were given by default. Can you remove additional white spaces on test case 3 and 4 ?",

    "content": "Edited the text, main changes being:\n\n1. Changed the time unit from \"cycle\" to \"second\". Easier to understand that way.\n\n2. Added that the robbers are foolish and the puzzle requires the player to calculate the time for trying ALL the combinations. (Why doesn't the robber stop and work on the next vault after finding the correct combination for the one he's working on?)\n\n3. Added the assumption that it takes no time to move around.\n\n4. Rewording / reordering for better presentation and clarity.\n\n5. Renamed the validators to be the same as the test cases. More meaningful that way.\n\n6. Added output in stub generator.\n\nAt the current puzzle setting (always working on the next greater-index vault) the puzzle is easy. It is ok to consider changing the puzzle type to clash of code, but it is fine for it to remain as a community puzzle.\n\nI imagine that a harder version of the puzzle would involve optimisation (cleverer robbers!) and finding which vaults each robber should work on in order to minimise the total time.",
