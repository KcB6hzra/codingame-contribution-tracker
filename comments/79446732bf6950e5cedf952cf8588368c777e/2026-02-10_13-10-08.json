    "content": "- You're referencing \"H\" and \"W\" in the input, but have \"h\" and \"w\" in the stub generator. It would be great to harmonize, either by having \"H\" and \"W\" in the stub generator, or \"h\" and \"w\" everywhere, or even just have \"{{height}}\" and \"{{width}}\" everywhere.\n- I've taken forever to understand the \"from the first column to the last column of the grid\". Could you emphasize that using markup please?\n- \"The path can be traced both horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally\" -> I interpreted this as \"either a line or a column must be fully + for you to output 1\". It may be more exact to write something like \"Every move happens either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally\".\n- The interpretation above could be interesting to throw a try and get some positive results before hitting harder puzzles though, and both test 1 and validator 1 should have a full line of +es, to at least get a few percents.\n\nOnce these issues are adressed, I'm ok approving the contribution :)",

However, with larger test cases recursion would fail due to recursion depth limits.\n\nI consider making a more intricate puzzle, perhaps one with: larger grid sizes, the length of the shortest path as output, grids with depth (3D), and so on.\n\nDo you see other ways in which this puzzle can be made more interesting? I'd love to know.\n\nBest Regards,\nSuryyy",
