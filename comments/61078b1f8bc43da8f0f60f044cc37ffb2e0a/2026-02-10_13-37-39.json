Here is my second version of the code:\n\nn=gets.to_i\nserve=[*$<][-2].chomp  # Get second to last serve\na=[4,(n/2)+1].max\nb=n-a\nscores=[a,b]\nscores.reverse! if serve == \"ad-out\" || serve=~/^(0|15|30)/  # Switch if ad-out or 0,15 or 30 first score\nputs scores*?-",

    "content": "I would say at the statement that in tennis the score increments 4 times (15,30,40,45). If the player gets to 45 points then the player wins the game and it will displayed as 'game'. If both players are draw (both with 40 points) it will be displayed as 'deuce'. Between 'deuce' and 'game',  to win the game the player will have to win 2 points. The first point will be displayed as 'advantage'. If the player with the advantage wins the point, it will be displayed as 'game' else it will come back to 'deuce'.\n\n0 => 15 => 30 => 40 => game\n\ndeuce <=> advantage <=> game \n\nI would put the focus for example, if having a certain scoreboard, the game could be win with any of the players. The way it's requested the output to be printed right now, it's not clear at all.",
