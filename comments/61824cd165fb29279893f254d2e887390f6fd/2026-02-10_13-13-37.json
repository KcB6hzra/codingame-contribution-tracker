    "content": "You don't have any test cases that evaluate to a negative answer, only validators. It would be good to swap some of these around so that clashers can debug issues in the clash, rather than getting 100% on the test cases and then submitting and getting 77% on validators.\n\nThe second 'medium' example and the last 'hard' example are the two that currently evaluate to negatives.\n\nNegatives are an important edge case, because you might naively just have a while loop that keeps looking for \"+-*/\" and doesn't stop until they are all gone, but of course for negative results, this loop won't stop because the \"-\" can't be simplified with more loops.\n\nI suggest you swap the two \"medium\" tests so that the negative one becomes a test case and the positive one becomes a validator.",

    "content": "You should mention that when rounding to two decimal places, if the decimal places are empty,  you fill them with 0.\n\nI also feel like that this is a bit too hard for 15 minutes, It might fit better for a puzzle, but this is way too hard for a clash. You would need a very good logic understanding for this, and it might take some time for people to figure it out, and then to code it would just take more then 15 minutes.\n\nI think that it would suit better if this was changed to a puzzle instead of an clash.",

Please delete the 3rd paragraph.\n\n* 5.0 + ((1.0 + 2.0) * 4.0 + 3.0) is wrong.\n\n* Please change \"higher centesimal 10^-2\" to \"2 decimal places\".\n\nInput section\n* Please change \"Ligne\" to \"Line\".\n\nConstraints section\n* Please remove the 2nd and 3rd constraints as they are not constraints on the possible test cases.\n\nCases\n* While Goal section mentions the rounding requirement, it does not mention how many decimal places should be shown in the output. I would suggest you to revise the cases and your solution to always show 2 decimal places for simplicity. Otherwise, please state the relevant requirement in Goal section.\n\n* Please add at least 1 more pair of cases where the rounding requirement is actually tested (currently NONE of the cases requires any rounding; all results are exact results).\n\nThanks.",
