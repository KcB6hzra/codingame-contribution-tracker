However, the suggested traffic safety rule might be arguable. \n\n\"There is another car directly to the right that is traveling the same speed\" == not safe, and else (implied) is safe.\n\nIf there is a car to my right, I would not regard it safe to change lane at this moment no matter it is faster, slower or same speed as I am. I would wait until the right is clear before considering to change.",
