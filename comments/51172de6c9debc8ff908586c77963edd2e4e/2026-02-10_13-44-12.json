Two validators return YES, two returns NO, so a standard print \"YES\" or print \"NO\" gets you only 50%. Nicely balanced.",

    "content": "A few notes:\n* (A string without 1 palindrome substring is also a perfect string) <- this is not needed because every non-empty string has palindrome subsatrings (namely the one character substrings).\n* The first sentence should be:\n  * A string is called a perfect string if all of its palindrome substrings have odd length.\n* Input: \"s string\" Small s not capital so it matches the stub.\n* The stub output is usually \"YES/NO\".\n* Output change: Write 'YES' if it is a perfect string, 'NO' if it isn't.\n* Constraint: \"length(s) <= 10^5\". The last test case reaches that.\n\nLet me just say that I loved your solution to this problem. It took me a minute to prove that it always works. So if you address the rephrasing, I'm happy to approve.",

Yes and No - while sounding very clumsy - is perfect because that's not the value of booleans ever, so you have to hardcode it in the same way in all languages.",

Look at Java and the need for a main class and method, compared to, say, python.\n\nIt doesn't mean we shouldn't do the little things that make it a bit more fair, though. So I agree with you on this specific topic.",

    "content": "Absolutely agree with you. Years ago I searched for code golfing in C#. One of the first results was: C# is designed to not do code golf. Then they gave a few tips, but it was a very funny headline.\n\nAnother added bonus if you like code golf is that the yes/no answer can teach you concepts like ternary operator. While searching for that you may find concepts like Kotlin's Elvis operator. I believe it can be a good ground for newcomers or those who want to learn new languages.",
