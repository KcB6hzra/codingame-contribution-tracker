    "content": "You bring up a great question. When is Algorithm X \"overkill\"? In the playground, I cover several puzzles where I ultimately didn't use Algorithm  X, so it appears that in those puzzles, I felt Algorithm X was indeed overkill, right?\n\nI have thought about this question off and on for 2 years now and today I have a new question in my head: Why have I not written about this in the playground? I will try to put some thoughts together and add a discussion page.\n\nObviously, \"overkill\" is a subjective opinion and depends on factors such as goals. If my goal was to win a competition based on speed, I feel I could put an exact cover solution together quite a bit faster than a classic recursion approach...on a puzzle of this complexity anyway. I also feel confident that the solution, despite being thrown together as quickly as possible, would be very readable by most, if not all, of the CodinGamers that have been through this playground. After all, it would look extremely similar to all my other exact cover solutions.\n\nI like to use numpy arrays on CodinGame puzzles that involve 2-demensional grids. I have often felt like the numpy arrays were overkill. I usually thought to myself, \"Maybe they are, but they are so cool!\" And, I kept on using them.\n\nI'm rambling...or maybe I'm just starting to write that new page. Great comment. Thank you for the approval. I have this new idea added to my to-do list.",

    "content": "I haven't completely solved yet.  I did some basic analysis to see if a directed search could be accomplished via pre-sorting.  so with the puzzle constraints for n,right side (rs)there are only 69 actual equations.  So for test 4...it becomes 6 choose 69 w/o repetition calc of 119Million.  with the actual rs possible for that test it becomes  4x4x4x5x6x6=11,520 combos of a maximum search space. compared to test 10 15 choose 69=5x10^15, but the actual rs values make it 1x1x1x1x2x3x3x4x4x4x4x5x6x6x6x6=4.7B .  Interesting because the first 4 equations that should be set are requisite to the solution.  Obviously the number occurrence counts trim the search space considerably, but doing this speedily with Alg X overhead is not desirable imo.  The actual distribution of the operand occ over the 69 equations (1-9) is 13 18 19 18 16 14 14 13 13.  Which implies to me that there's very little benefit in equation ordering (beyond rs values) other than the desired output format.  While the total set of possible puzzles would seem to be 6^9=10M and thus 10M solutions, this isn't realistic with n unless we are always considering n as a minimum.  so presorting the rs values in this order: 26 19 23 22 28 17 21 20 25 27 24 13 18 5 15 7 11 16 14 4 6 10 9 8 12 should speed up any search.  And obviously there's no equations that exist for 26,19,23,& 22. And what i would call group 6 are 8 9 10 12, where each rs has 6 equations.  I assume a 24x24 lookup table with occ.cnt minimums may trim possible leafs late in the search as well, but i doubt speed anything up.  think-typing.  I can't visualize a bitwise eval, but memoization is neccessary imo. looking at the answers ... 3803 doesn't have alot of factors so I can only assume than many distinct paths must be explored almost in their entirety.  Which i calc at 537M.  When reduced along the search, the space is much smaller... but i still think it's ~179M... so within CG limits I'm uncertain it's solvable for all languages.",
