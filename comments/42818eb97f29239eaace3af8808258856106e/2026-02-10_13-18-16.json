If you want to add this puzzle to shortest, I think you should increase the complexity by giving the equation of a line, equation of shortest distance from a point to a line, and giving more than 2 points to the players. But overall, great puzzle",

Although, I find it pretty interesting and definitely must be approved , It's quite fun !\n ( A programmer should know some math concepts, at least from school, I was not trying to justify the ignorance towards linear algebra :D )",

Would leaving some hints for the process improve it?\n\nFor constraints,\nGood that you've specified points 2 and 3, but somehow they are redundant (at least point 2, since point 1 mentioning that all inputs are integers already ensures that the integers can be either positive, negative or zero).",

I think it's a neater description and easy enough to understand if a test case fails.\nAlternatively, use a comma after 'decimal point, keep'.",
