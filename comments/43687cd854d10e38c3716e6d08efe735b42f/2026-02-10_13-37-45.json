Any good reason for it ?\n* The height of the grid is not given directly in the input, which is tedious to deal with when you don't have access to dynamically sized arrays.\n* Because the root is always at the bottom center, some of the displayed circles are never used, there's no way to \"reach\" them.\n\nOverall it's a good puzzle but it needs some polish.",
