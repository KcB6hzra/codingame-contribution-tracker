    "content": "This is a pretty hard clash.\nJust got it and won with 50% (7/8 clashers got 0%).\nFiguring out how the head works is hard to debug since you never see the whole right answer until your answer is almost correct (IDE corrects only the first wrong line).\nReverse might actually be easier than other modes for this one, as trying to understand the statement takes a lot of time and it's still a bit confusing.\n\nThe \"s/2+1\" part in particular is confusing, since you don't define the indexing as 1-indexed but it's needed to be clear since for s=2, \"s/2+1\"=2 saying that the \"w\" should be in the 2nd column of the output (1-indexed).\nI overlooked this and tried to code it in 0-indexed with the same formula and couldn't make even cases work in the end.",
