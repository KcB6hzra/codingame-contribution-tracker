    "content": "This is way too complicated for a reverse clash.\nThere is nothing intuitive about it.\n\nI just got it in a clash and the only people who solved it were the two bots. I came 3rd with 77% by finding some very confusing patterns that worked some of the time, but I couldn't figure out the true pattern.\n\nIt's very misleading that the amount of the words \"left\" and \"right\" shown don't mean anything (I thought there must be some logic to this), and it also doesn't mean anything whether the start, middle or end of the word is shown.\n\nThere is too much pointless complications to this clash that makes it very annoying to get as a clash. One person got 44% in my clash, and the other 4 all got 0%. It's really not a coding challenge at all, it's just a very complicated lateral thinking puzzle...\n\nThe fact that you also need to take the answer modulo 100, and the pattern is about \"2*x-y\" where x and y swap depending on whether part of the word \"left\" or \"right\" is shown is just not at all intuitive and makes for a boring, frustrating clash.",

I deliberately only include strings part of 'left' and 'right', because that is the only two operations (either guess the number left of the two given numbers, or the number right of the two given numbers). If I would give a string not part of left or right, I would not know what behavior to associate with that (I could make it 'none' - but that would at the same time add complexity to the clash).\n\nIn any case, your feedback together with silence from others is an important signal that this clash might have not clear enough hints. I am thinking about turning the strings just all into 'left' or 'right' (possibly with capital variations). What do you think?",
