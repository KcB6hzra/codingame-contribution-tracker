    "content": "Goal section\n* Please change \"hand\" to \"hands\".\n\n* It seems \"smaller\" is a better word than \"shorter\"?\n\n* Please format \"ERROR\" as a {{constant}}, remove the quotation marks, and add a full stop.\n\n* It's confusing by mentioning both \"analog clock\" and \"digital clock\" in Goal section, but only \"digital clock\" in Input section. I think it's better to change the introductory sentence e.g.\n\nA shop sells both digital clocks and analog clocks. Given time in hh:mm format in 24-hour notation shown in one of the digital clocks, …\n\nInput section\n* Please change \"24-h\" to \"24-hour\".\n\nOutput section\n* Please change \"hand\" to \"hands\".\n\n* It seems \"smaller\" is a better word than \"shorter\"?\n\n* Please format \"ERROR\" as a {{constant}}.\n\n* Based on your solution code, you are rounding DOWN to the nearest integer instead of just rounding to the nearest integer. Please check if the word \"DOWN\" should be added.\n\n* Also I think there may be a difference between two methods (though I have not tested it):\n(a) no rounding during the calculation until the final answer\n(b) rounding during the calculation (like your code does)\n\nYou should probably state clearly the method that should be followed in the statement.\n\nThanks.",
