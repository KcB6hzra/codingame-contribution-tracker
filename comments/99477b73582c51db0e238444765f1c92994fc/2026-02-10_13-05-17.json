    "content": "Agreed with StepBack. \n\nI really liked playing it out, but it did take me longer than 5 minutes (under normal non-reverse conditions, but as StepBack mentioned, looking at the test cases, I don't think that would have sped anything up or slowed anything down)\n\nIt's a creative clash that surprisingly works really well for Reverse.\nI solved in under 15 minutes, and am sure it def could be solved in under 5.\n\nIf the community agrees that it can be solved in under 5 minutes, I'd really like to see this as a clash :)",
