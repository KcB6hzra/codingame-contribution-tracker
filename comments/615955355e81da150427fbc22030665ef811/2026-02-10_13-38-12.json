    "content": "I also thought this was an interesting challenge, and actually somewhat related to real-world code-breaking. But, as a C++ programmer, I found it just a little too difficult. It shouldn't have been, but it was. If I ask myself why, it's because of searching for the indexes of characters in the alphabet. It could use a default A-Z and _ and it would still be challenging enough to be interesting. Believe it or not, I didn't manage to code it in 15 minutes.",
