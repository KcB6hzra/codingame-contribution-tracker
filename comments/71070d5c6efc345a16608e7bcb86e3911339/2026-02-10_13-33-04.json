    "content": "Please add to the constraints that you can assume that the tree shadows are not over-lapping.\n\nThis is CRITICAL to the solution and isn't currently mentioned. I just did this clash and was so confused at first how I'm meant to solve this.\n\nThe zenith part is irrelevant and confusing. We are given the radius of each tree's shadow. You should make that clear. At zenith the shadow will be the same as the area of the tree only at the correct latitude for that time of year, so the zenith part is not really that helpful and it makes the problem seem a LOT harder than it is.\n\nNot very fair to clashers who speak English as a second language, I found this hard to read as a native speaker. Three people quit with 0% in my clash after 3 minutes.",

    "content": "I am sorry but, contrary to what some have stated, the statement is not clear at all.\nFirst, it is assumed that all the trees cast a shadow only on the lawn (that is, there is no tree close enough to the border such that part of its shadow is cast outside the lawn). I see no such guarantee in the statement.\nSecondly, it is also assumed that the angle between the sun rays and the local horizon at solar noon is exactly 90° (i.e the solar zenith angle is 0°).\nThat is only true between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, and only twice a year at very specific dates depending on the latitude. (Google Lahaina Noon)\nIn any other part of the world, or at any other date, this simply does not hold true.\nPlease have a look at this graph: \nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Solar_Zenith_Angle_min.png\nAs you can see the zenith angle can be very large depending on your latitude and the time of the year, causing great variations in the expected output.",
