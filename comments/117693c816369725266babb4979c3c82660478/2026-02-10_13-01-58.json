Without the ADD INST COUNT instruction i think it would be good for CoC? i think that because i have little difficult understanding the ADD INST COUNT instruction... and almost all code was done but that instruction took me a lot :)",

    "content": "Adapted from https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/96639d99d371145cad0fa68591700eb86eb6c, comments said it was too long/complex for a CoC so submitting it as a puzzle here (7 months after because I was kinda busy).\n\nCover was made by screenshotting the output of the following thematic program:\n\n```\nfrom random import choice, choices, randint\n\naddp = lambda: \"/$\" + \"\".join(choices(\"$*.\", k=randint(1, 5))) + \"/\"\naddn = lambda: \"//\" + \"\".join(choices(\"$*.\", k=randint(1, 5))) + \"/\"\nmulp = lambda: \"/**\" + \"\".join(choices(\"$*.\", k=randint(1, 5))) + \"/\"\nmuln = lambda: \"/*/\" + \"\".join(choices(\"$*.\", k=randint(1, 6))) + \"/\"\naddc = lambda: \"$\"\n\nfor f in choices([addp, addn, mulp, muln, addc], [10, 9, 5, 4, 1], k=10000):\n    print(f(), end=\"\")\n\nprint()\n```\n\nFor the record (mostly when the rejected contribution will be deleted), the original comments were the following:\n\n<mathferm> The description is clear and the puzzle quite interesting, not easy to code in less than 5min but definitely doable\n\n<aflorido> This is a fantastic puzzle, but I found it impossible to solve in under 15 minutes.\n\nIt takes some time to read the statement and the tests, then the implementation's difficulty depends a lot on the language of choice, and debugging when a case fails is not easy because manually reading and understanding a long string with only 3 different symbols takes some time. The characters /*$ being special regex characters only adds to this difficulty.\n\nGreat job on the puzzle, I would certainly enjoy this as a standalone puzzle, but it was way too hard for a clash for me. If other users disagree and tell me they solved it in time without checking the author's solution (bonus points if not in python), I will remove the rejection.\n\n<LeMasSon> same reason as Aflorido, I don't think that for the majority of people this is feasible under 5mins.\n\nIt would make an excellent puzzle\n\n<Stef_3> I solved it in 5 minutes with two caveats:\n- I read the instructions before starting my timer; reading the instructions probably adds at least 3 minutes if not more\n- I didn't bother to handle SYNTAX ERROR; handling it properly would easily add another 5 minutes.\n\nI suggest removing SYNTAX ERROR from the description if you want to keep it as a Clash and not as a Puzzle: the time constraint is already hard enough if we can trust the input to be a correct program.\n\n<cppprogrammer> too hard to solve under 5 minutes\n\n(total: 1 approval, 3 rejections)",
