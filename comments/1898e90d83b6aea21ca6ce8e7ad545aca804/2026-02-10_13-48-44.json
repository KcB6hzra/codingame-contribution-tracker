What you mean is clearly that any two of the circles intersect at some point. What it can be understood after the first question is that all of the circles intersect at the same point on the plane.\nOn the positive side, that note on tangent circles is great and I like this problem. You have to think a little but the solution is almost trivial to code. If you clarify those little things I mentioned, I will approve it.\n\nOne more thing: I don't know why people don't use periods at the end of sentences in the description but it is so much nicer with them.",
