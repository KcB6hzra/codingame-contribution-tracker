If you want the exercise to not be so complex, I recommend adding 2 spaces (one in front and one in the back) to the two points \" : \" in this way the input line would have a width of 15, making it easier to divide digits into a width of 3 characters.",

I personally was not able to finish in 5min, but believe it to be 100% possible. \n\nI took the approach of turning each number into a 9character string (ex. \" _ | ||_|\"), then switching for each digit. There's probs a more optimal way to do it, but I enjoyed the clash :).",
