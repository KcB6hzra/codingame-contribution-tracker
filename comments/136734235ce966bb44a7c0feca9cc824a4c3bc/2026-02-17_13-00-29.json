An idea would be to say that when a SNAP happens, the player with the best suit is the quickest to say it (following order H > D > C > S). i.e. if player1 plays 3D and then player2 plays 3C, player1 is the one snapping the central pile.\n\nI think it is a good puzzle to introduce Queues and Stacks containers.",

Better yet, since the statement already mentions that a snap occurs when the ranks match, it's clearer to give direct examples instead of introducing the term \"court card\" (e.g. {{A}} matches {{A}}, {{6}} matches {{6}}, {{Q}} matches {{Q}}).\n\n* Just a note: the original wording \"court cards only match with the same court card\" could be confusing, as it might imply that suits must also match, though the subsequent examples clarify this isn't the case.\n\n* Consider changing \"LAST\" to \"MATCHING\".\n\nInput\n* Please delete the last sentence.\n\n* Next m Lines: Please add \"from top to bottom\".\n\n* Next n Lines: Please add \"from top to bottom\".\n\nOutput\n* Please exclude \"/\" from the {{constant}} format.\n\nConstraints\n* 1st constraint: Please add \", [[m]] + [[n]]\" after \"[[n]]\".\n\nThanks.",

There will never be ties, since it's impossible for both players to run out of cards at the same time (except in the no-card scenario).\n\nJust one point:\n\nInput\n* The text uses \"player 1's deck\" and \"player 2's deck\" with \"the\" in some places but without it in others.
