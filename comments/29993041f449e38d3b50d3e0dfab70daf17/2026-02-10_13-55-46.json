Apparently, the plural of pegasus is pegasi, according to several sources including:\n\nhttps://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pegasus\n\nSince all the species are plural (Rabbits, Cows, etc.), do you want to change \"Pegasus\" to \"Pegasi\" or do you want to leave it? I can understand either decision since this is such a nonstandard usage.",
