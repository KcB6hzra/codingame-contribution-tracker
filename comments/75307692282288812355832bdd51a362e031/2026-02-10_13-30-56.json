I think that it would be better to present the expected output during the presention of the statment to make the one who is doing it more used to it mainly if it's in the fastest mode.",

Possibly, I viewed from different angle, so I will write what I thought as a note.\n\nIn my image of daily life, the hole is typically round and near to circle, and not a square.

In real world, two holes may be so near and they may be jumped over at the same time.",
