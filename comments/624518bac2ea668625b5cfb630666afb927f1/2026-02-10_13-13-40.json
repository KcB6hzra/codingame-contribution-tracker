    "content": "Some suggestions :)\n\n*Input:\n   - add, in bold, which line it is -> <<Line 1>>: A positive integer [[N]\n   - move the constraints for the inputs to the constraints section -> 1 ≤ [[N]] ≤ 1000\n   - Add a note saying that [[score]] will be an integer(since I don't see it being a float in the test cases)\n\n*output:\n    - <<Next [[K]] Lines>>: [[name]] [[avgScore]] [[letterGrade]] --> This I am a bit uncertain about because this seems a bit weird, but the current description for output is not very clear. We can see what 5DN1L thinks about this\n   - move the grading scale to the goal area\n\n*Stub generator:\n   - You can consider changing the input style from a \"[[name]] {{scores in [[k]] subjects}}\" to \"[[name]] [[k]]\" then loop [[k]] to get each score, so in the stub generator that would be a double for loop. Below is code written in not a particular coding language to help you visualize what I mean. I feel like that maybe this would be a bit easier to work with, but this one really depends on you.\nint N = readInput()\nfor(int i = 0; i<N;i++){\n   string input = readInput().split(' ')\n   string name = input[0]\n   int k = input[1]\n   for(int j = 0; j<k;j++) {\n      int score = readInput()\n   }\n}\n\n\nThis is a cool clash! I'm looking forward to seeing it in action!",

    "content": "The letter grade F never shows up in your tests and validators, what's the point of keeping it ?\nMoreover, I fear that the precise boundaries between letters may be hard to figure for a reverse, for example, giving the tests, you could observe that B is everything below 91.25 and above 79.99, but that would not pass the last validator. Even if it is more natural to say it's 90, the point is that you can't know for sure.",

Only by forcing them to parse it, will prevent them to do it in 15 seconds XD\n\nAnd again thank you so much for the suggestions",
