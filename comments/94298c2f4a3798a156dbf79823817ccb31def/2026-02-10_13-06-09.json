    "content": "Yeah, I was thinking on what to do for the second part. The input consists of a number, but it's easier to handle it as a string and it's awkward to just convert a number back to a string when you already can directly take it as one.\nI guess I'll just replace number with \"a string of digits\"\nAnd yeah, now that I think of it, I can't be very sure if others find it easy on reverse mode. We'll wait for others to validate, I guess.\nThank you.",
