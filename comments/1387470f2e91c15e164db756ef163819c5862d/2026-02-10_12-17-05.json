I did't find any issues with the implementation itself. The points below are for improvement rather than bug reports.\n\nViewer\n* I'm not sure whether the viewer animation should leave a trail as it moves along the path. That should make the path clearer, but in any case, it'll probably become difficult to see without zooming in when N grows larger.\n\nCases\n* There aren't any cases where N is a 2-digit odd number. Please add a pair or two.\n\n* For N ≥ 20, the starting points are consistently very close to the grid edges. Could some of them be positioned further inside?\n\n* None of the visible tests use starting points on the left or right edges. Please update at least one test to include such a scenario. For reference, here's a summary of existing edge/corner starting points:\n\n  • Corners: N=4 (Test & Validator), N=30 (Validator)\n\n  • Left/right edges: N=6 (Validator)\n\n  • Top/bottom edges: N=10 (Test), N=50 (Validator)\n  \n* From the summary, it appears that N is always even when the starting point is on an edge or at a corner. Would it be possible to include cases with odd N as well?\n\nThanks.",

It may help to state this explicitly in the statement.\n\n* Example 2:\n\n  • Consider specifying the palindrome formed, for the players' convenience.\n\n  • Consider replacing all letters not used in the path with distinct characters to make the path clearer. For example:\n\naaaq\nrbst\naavb\nuaaa\n\n(If you use this grid, the path would need to be updated accordingly.)\n\nConstraints\n* I don't recall seeing other CG puzzles with an execution time limit that long (25 seconds). Was this limit chosen based on your Python solution? You mentioned that your solution could pass all test cases for the previous version within 5 seconds. How does your latest code perform on the current version?\n\nCases\n* I noticed five pairs of cases where the test input is identical to the validator. However, since there are 50 pairs in total, this duplication isn't much of an issue.\n\nThanks again.",

Since players can set the language to PHP and copy-paste the grid to observe the behavior, I don't believe the clarity of the text grid is a major concern.\n\nConstraints\n* The limit was indeed chosen based on my Python solution. There are two primary worst case scenarios for execution time. I measured the performance using time.perf_counter in the CodinGame IDE over 10 runs for each case. The results are:\n\nWorst Case 1: min = 3944ms, avg = 8207ms, max = 17931ms\nWorst Case 2: min = 4487ms, avg = 9930ms, max = 18115ms\n\nI have set the time limit to 25 seconds to be lenient. I have chosen not to reduce N as it might allow simpler C++ solutions to pass easily.\n\nCases\n* Three pairs (N=5, 7, 19) of them are intentional edge cases that should remain.\n* While the other two (N=9, 15) could be adjusted, I'm not sure if it's necessary. I'll keep them as is for now.",
