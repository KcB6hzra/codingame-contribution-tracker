The only thing I'd suggest is making it more clear that the characters used for the triangles differ from test to test - I didn't realise this at first.",

I’m not gonna deny this as maybe my POV is wrong, but i would maybe suggest decreasing N to <=3 or 4, in order to simplify the complex nature that comes from the recursive pattern and layout.

I agree the 4th test might catch some copy-pasters, but they'd still pass 3 out of 4, which undermines the goal. That’s why it’s important to keep tests and validators distinct, to discourage hardcoding and promote actual problem-solving.\n\nAs for both your current and revised ideas, there's a practical limit: once N > 4, the output size exceeds the maximum character limit. You'll need to rethink the output format so that you can differentiate tests and validators. One option could be to output only the first 1000 characters, though that might make the output visually less appealing.",
