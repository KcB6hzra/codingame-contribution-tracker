    "content": "This is a cool clash, but the test/validators aren't strong enough to really force players to solve the problem.\n\nI got beaten in shortest mode by someone who simply made an array of the words, then removed duplicate words from the array and printed them back out as a sentence.\nThis got 100% on all validators and was able to get down to only 24 characters in Ruby!\n\nI was only able to get down to 34, because I was solving the actual problem and didn't think it could be reduced to something so much simpler.\nIt would be good to add a new tests/validators pair that requires some duplicate words in the output, to avoid this hack.\n\ne.g.\nInput\nFran had a friend who had several rabbits and several foxes\nOutput\nFran had a friend who had several rabbits and foxes",

It is most definitely solvable in the clash time and works for all modes in my opinion. \n\nIf you wanted to increase the difficulty a little bit, you could have a test case for a sentence already in proper form: \"John has a cat and dog\".",
