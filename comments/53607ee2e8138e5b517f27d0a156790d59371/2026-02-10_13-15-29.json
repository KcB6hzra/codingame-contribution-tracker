    "content": "Nice clash, but it's quite hard to understand how the precedence of the sorting works in-clash from just your statement.\n\nI'd change:\n\"Characters case does matter in sorting : words with first letter uppercase will appear after lowercase words (\"Hello\" after \"hello\").\" to\n\"Characters case does matter in sorting : words with first letter uppercase will appear after lowercase words that are otherwise the same (\"Hello\" after \"hello\").\"\n\nOtherwise it sounds like you mean that all capitalised words should come after all words thata aren't.\n\nI'd similarly change the Output line to:\n\"the [[words]] string sorted by length and alphabetically for words of same length, with capitalised words sorted after their uncapitalised versions.\"\n\nI'd also add a constraint that:\n\"Uppercase characters will only ever appear at the start of a word\"",

    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: Clear objective: The goal of the challenge is well-defined. Participants need to sort the given string of words by their length and alphabetically (ascending order) for words of the same length. The character case matters in the sorting.\n\nInput and Output: The input and output format is clearly described, with examples provided to help participants understand what is expected.\n\nConstraints: The constraints on the number of words in the string, as well as the word length, are provided, ensuring the problem remains solvable and within reasonable bounds.\n\nExample: The provided example helps participants understand the expected output format and how the sorting should be performed.\n\nOverall, the challenge is well-structured, and the requirements are well-defined, making it suitable for publication.",
