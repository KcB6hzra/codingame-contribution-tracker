    "content": "Reading the problem statement from top to bottom, it is still a bit confusing when you get to the example and you see \"start\", the \">\" and \"<\" signs, and the column of numbers without much explanation.  \n\nSomething to this effect may make it clearer:\n===\nAn old safe has a dial lock with numbers 0 to 89.  The dial may be turned in either direction.  Being that is an old safe, it will open if the final value on which the dial stops is within 3 numbers of the KEY in either direction.\n\nYour task is to determine: (1) if the safe opens or not; and (2) the final value on the dial.\n\nYou will be provided with a COMBINATION (maybe START value and sequence of TURNS is clearer?) which you must follow to determine whether the safe can be opened.  The COMBINATION is made up of a start value for the dial followed by a series of turns.  Each turn is comprised of:  (1) a \">\" (indicating turn right) or \"<\" (turn left) sign;  and (2) an integer value telling you how far to turn in that direction.\n\nFor example, for the combination: \n\n0>80<50>100<5>14<20\n\nthe dial starts at 0, then the following turns occur:\n\n>80 --> turn right 80, leaving the dial pointing at 80\n<50 --> turn left 50, leaving the dial pointing at 30\n>100 --> turn right 100, leaving the dial pointing at 40\n<5 --> turn left 5, leaving the dial at 35\n>14 --> turn right 14, leaving the dial at 49\n<20 --> turn left 20, leaving the dial at 29\n\nSince the final reading on the dial is 29, which is within 3 of 30, the safe can be opened.  \n\nYour output should be:\nOPEN\n29\n===\n\nTwo other points more generally about the problem:\n\n(1) In a conventional lock where the numbers are on the dial, if you turn clockwise/right, the numbers actually go backwards (and vice versa for counter clockwise/left).  Unless you mean the pointer is what spins and the numbers do not spin but are stationary on the safe...\n\n(2) It is a little unexpected to have only one number in the combination and not 3 numbers in the combination as was mentioned below.  The typical 3 \"key\" combination master lock requiring x turns to the right, y turns to the left, z turns to the right landing within 3 of each key would make the problem harder and more realistic.",

    "content": "Interesting puzzle.\nIt seems to me your solution would not work for test cases where for instance 1 is the key and 89 is the number you stop at. Since the dial is round the \"distance\" is in fact less than 3 but using  a simple abs would not take that into account. Unless we are not supposed to compute the distance on the dial but then I think the statement \"within 3 numbers or closer in either direction to the KEY.\" could be misinterpreted.  But maybe that's just because I'm not a native speaker.",
