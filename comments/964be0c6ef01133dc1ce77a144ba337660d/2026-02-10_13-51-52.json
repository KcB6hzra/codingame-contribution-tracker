    "content": "Ok, I'm back.\n\nI've tried to solve it again, but it appears it's not quite ready for that yet :/\n\nThe easy fixes:\n- \"face\" -> \"heads\" (plural)\n- some note that BBS requires ints larger than 2^64 would be appreciated (it's not obvious from the first case, and makes for hellish debug once you think it's ok)\n- it seems like the validators refuse to have the treasure on the entrance and exit, but it's not really obvious to me from the statement.\n- the [[variable]] formatting makes for completely unreadable formulas, be it in map dimensions or BBS. (well at least they're copy-pastable, but still). I'd suggest not using it there.\n\nAnd now the hellish part that made it so hard to get right:\n- W and L are neither usual (in CG puzzles) nor correctly used here.  In math, W/L could make sense describing a generic rectangle, with W <= L. This isn't the case here, we've got cases where W > L.\n- made worse by the fact the first examples are square, and the first rectangle happens to also be a big one, so it can more easily time out than serve as a debugging help at that point.\n\nSuggestions:\n- back to H (there's actually one left in te statement)\n- make the first case a rectangle\n- find some terminology to more naturally disambiguate the parts of the statements where coordinates refer to the W*H maze, and where they refer to the (2W+1)(2H+1) graphical representation of it.\n\nStill a great problem idea. I'm almost ready to approve.",

I'm not (really) an english native, but I think you've really got to choose one between \"slayed\" and \"slain\".\n* \"in order to\" twice in the same sentence is a bit much\n* \"depth H\" ?!\n* the alg description paragraph is a bit hard to read. I'd suggest expressing the maze-edge case with words instead of math.\n* it's not obvious to me why the algorithm results in long corridors in south and east. Especially with the example\n* (at second reading) may be due to the highly unusual match between the w/h input and the (2w+1)(2h+1) output\n* \"distance SD\" errr... why?\n* PRNG: it's vital to the program validity, it's weird (to me) to have to find it in a \"Notes\" section\n* and it's not that readable. I'll try and help.\n* without clicking on the links, I have interest in the PRNG one, but don't spontaneously understand why the maze-generation one would be relevant.\n\nThat seems like a lot. I do like:\n- the theme\n- you thought of guaranteeing solution unicity before I came along and complained about it. Kudos!\n\nIt's nothing too innovative as far as the CG platform goes, but it's a nice fit for a subproblem complexity combination, and it's well set. I'd like to see this approved.",
