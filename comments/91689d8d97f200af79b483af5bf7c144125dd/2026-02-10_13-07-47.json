Currently the tests and validators are all over the place, you can easily come up with code that passes tests but fails validators. Especially the last validator is evil, how do you expect players to anticipate that they need to account for floating point inaccuracy?",

Please note, that I've also considered other aspects in the test cases, not only different separators:\n- float and int in different combinations,\n- duplicate numbers (i.e. storing in set will fail),\n- individual values are from one category, but the sum is from another, both greater and lower,\n- borderline cases, e.g. exactly 1000.",

    "content": "Thank you for the revisions.\n\nThe \"no separator\" case (1000) now appears in a test only. Please include one in a validator as well.\n\nI'm sorry, but I disagree with your argument. The earlier cases should be simple and enable to let the players to write the basic code. The mixed separator cases come out of the blue because nowhere in the statement mentions that, and it's not a real life case. A player won't normally expect that until he sees it at the very end.\n\nI did see the coverage of floats and integers was ok so I didn't make any comment on that.\n\nI don't see why one would want to use a set in this clash, so I don't see duplicate numbers being something relevant here.\n\nOther points: Noted.",
