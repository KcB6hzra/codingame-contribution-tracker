I got 100% on tests in a Shortest mode clash just now and then only 80% on validators.\n\nThe problem is the '-' symbol in Validator 3 causes issues for the 'tr' function in Ruby and other languages. Please add another test case that has '-' as a symbol, so that people can debug this problem in the clash, rather than finding out after they submit.",

    "content": "If you want to have this as a \"fastest\" clash i'd rather you just instruct the player to swap the requested characters. I don't think the language you used is familiar to everyone either. If you described the characters as having bit values 0 and 1 and asked for the ! of the value that would make more sense maybe. I like it as a reverse puzzle though. I do worry that this is too similar to a ATCG puzzle that asks for A's / T's and C's / G's to be flipped to complementary values. (Its DNA themed)",
