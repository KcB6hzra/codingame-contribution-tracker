    "content": "Hi alexcercos,\n\nthis looks like a nice exercise to play with ASCII art and printing of curves.\n\nHowever I don't get exactly the point of the instructions: I guess you want the coder to construct the linear, than the quadratic and than the cubic curve. At least that is what I infer from the instructions. For me it was not quite clear what to do. \"Interpolate\" was not precise enough: How to interpolate? What do I need to do in order to follow the steps? With the help of wikipedia I inferred that I need to calculate the weights - here called \"interpolation values\" - from the number of steps and apply at every interpolation step.\n\nAdditionally one could just take the formula for the cubic curve and plug the numbers in using the weights as the curve parameters. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Cubic_B%C3%A9zier_curves\n\nWhat was the original intention of the exercise? Do you want to let the coder carry out each interpolation step or are you fine with using the formula? The latter is not very much instructive concerning the Bézier curves but is instead more streamlined and focuses more on ASCII and printing.\n\nCheers",

    "content": "Hi thanks for your feedback, I noticed also that when searching for what an interpolation is on internet it doesn't give very clear results (and I should specify that those are \"linear\" interpolations). I updated the description and also added the formula. I also named the steps as weights in the description, that's a better way of naming it too (but I left them as \"steps\" where it should be clearer that it's something to be performed X times).\n\nEven though the exercise would be intended to follow the instructions (and now I think it should be possible to get the result without doing any outside search), if anyone tried to use the formula directly he would get also the correct result but with more difficulty (it's shorter but more complex, basically all the interpolations collapsed) so I would be fine with that.",

The points at the beginning were needed because when using spaces they would be trimmed automatically (or the console ignore the empty lines, I don't fully remember but there were some issues when not having an initial character). Other option was to make a \"frame\" with other characters but there seem to be limitations on the amount of characters allowed as output (the high-resolution cases would need to be removed, I prefered to preserve them)",
