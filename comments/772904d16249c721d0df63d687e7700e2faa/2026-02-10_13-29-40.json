    "content": "I like it. Straightforward and clear, Upvoted.\n\nJust a couple of comments after trying it out.\n\nFor fastest and shortest mode it would be nice to write upfront what is meant by \"punctuation\". \n\nPunctuation can be many things like \",.;:[](){}-_\" and more.\n\ne.g. you can specify: \".,?!\" so there is no need to guess or look through the tests to find the answer. (which you can't right now because e.g. \"!\" is hidden in validator)\n\nI also think your test 4 and 5, and validators should match. e.g. in 4 you test \",\" but the validator test \"!\" at the end of the string, which is completely different. This means that you can have 100% correct in test cases, but will fail after submitting.",

But none of your tests show this, and the énoncé does not state anything also.\nMaybe your puzzle could be better specified if you clearly choose the mode you want to be used : faster ou reverse ?",
