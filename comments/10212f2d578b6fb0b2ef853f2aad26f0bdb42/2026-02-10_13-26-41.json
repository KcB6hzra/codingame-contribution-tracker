    "content": "Hi there, \n\nI enjoy solving this clash, but there are some problems: \n\n1) I think you can simplify the output. Use \"not enough\" instead of \"not enough sanitizer gel\". That will reduce the time when people are doing shortest mode on this clash. \n2) That would be great if you put explantion of how you get 96% in the example input, as I am a bit confused at first. \n\nThose are some minor problem and I think this is a really great clash to solve, great job. \n\nHere's my solution to this clash in Python:\n\ngel_amount = int(input())\nguest_count = int(input())\nfor i in range(guest_count):\n    guest_name = list(map(ord,list(input())))\n\n    while len(guest_name) != 1:\n        guest_name = list(map(int,list(str(sum(guest_name)))))\n\n    gel_amount-=(5*int(str(guest_name)[1:-1]))\nif gel_amount < 0: \n    print(\"Not enough sanitizer gel\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{int(gel_amount/10)}%\")\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEdit: \nI am not a very professional programmer so the code might be a bit over complicated so don't blame me on that. \n\nThank you",

    "content": "Good puzzle. Took me 10 minutes. My only feedback is to simplify it a bit. There's enough fun and complexity in the ASCII sum / digit sum part, that you don't need to distract the user with irrelevant info (max level of soap dispenser = 1L) and unit conversions (just use ml per push instead of mm^3, and maybe even round to 5 ml).",

Yes, you have to \"down-round\" (are this the correct words, if not, please tell me), and the second \"Trap\" is that you have to calculate with the  maximum level.\n\nI think the problem is to easy, if I tell this explicitly in an example. ;-)\n\nThanks for your Python-solution. Much shorter than my Pascal. I see... I have to learn Python... :smile:",

I update it soon, but first I need to replay the Test-Cases again, and consult my dictionary for the \"sanitizer-theme\".  ;-) \nBut the 1 Liter is not irrelevant, because the Result-Percent-Value depends on it. Or do you mean it is enough if it is told in the Constrains?",
