    "content": "This is a nice clash, that's pretty simple, but the statement is \"scary\" in its current form.\n\nClashers will often just quit when they see a clash that looks too hard to understand, which would be a shame for this one.\n\nI'd rewrite the first two paragraphs as below:\n\nAn ovulation predictor kit (OPK) can be used to predict fertility. This is signalled by a rise in luteinising hormone (LH), 24-36h before ovulation. The days before the LH surge, where estrogen levels are elevated, are also considered highly fertile. \n\nYour task is to write the software for an OPK. It needs to provide output for [[N]] days of measurements. Each day your program receives the measured levels of [[estrogen]] (in pg/ml) and [[LH]] (in mIU/ml).\n\nIf [[LH]] exceeds the threshold of {{50.0 mIU/ml}}, your program should output {{Peak fertility}}.\nOtherwise, if [[estrogen]] exceeds the threshold of {{100.0 pg/ml}}, your program should output {{High fertility}}.\nIf neither value exceeds the threshold, output {{Low fertility}}.",
