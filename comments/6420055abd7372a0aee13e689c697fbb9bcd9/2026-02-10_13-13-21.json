Please fix either the constraint or the cases.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "Thank you for making the changes. Regarding your question, I think it's a bit difficult to guess the requirement in Reverse mode; but to improve that:\n\n* There must be at least one more simple pair of cases to hint that it is wrong to assume that just summing up the digits is the right approach. (You aren't restricted to 4 pairs of cases.)\n\n* The first few pairs of cases would deal with 2 competitors only, and then the later pairs can deal with more.\n\nComments on the updated clash:\n\nInput section\n* Please delete \"Assume that the competitors have different names.\"\n\nConstraints section\n* Please delete the first constraint.\n\n* Please add:\n\n   • 1 <= each of the [[scores]] <= 9\n   \n   • [[name]] and [[name2]] are always different.\n\nCases\n* A greater variety of names are needed. Or just swapping the names in the validators is an improvement already.\n\nStub generator\n* Please update the variable names.\n\nThanks.",
