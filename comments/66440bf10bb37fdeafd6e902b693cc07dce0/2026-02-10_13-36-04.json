    "content": "I'm really divided on this one. I really like the puzzle; base conversion is always fun, but in this case it would be a trap, because unless you already really know how to write a decoder/encoder, this is really hard to pull off properly in less than 15 minutes. \n\nWhen I tried forgoing decoding entirely (by just replacing by the next symbol and carrying over as you go), it was a lot more manageable. Funny how the naive approach is often the fastest one for these!\n\nThat said, the statement is clear and well-formatted, and the test cases are very varied; I like this a lot. If this was any more complex (with maybe adding two different numbers for example instead of just +1), I think it would make a really nice classic puzzle.",

    "content": "I first tried converting the symbols to digits and this converted string to a number before adding 1, but then I realized there was no built-in method to convert the value back to a general base n. I could have probably written that fairly quickly, but this was already 5 minutes in, and the problem is really a lot simpler than all that.\n\nChanging strategies, I decided to increment the last digit myself, and just carry any overflow thru to the previous digit. If I had been able to do this in 5 minutes I would have passed it, and chalked up the lost time to poor planning. Surprisingly, it took me nearly another 10 minutes. Maybe I just wasn't thinking clearly?\n\nMy code still failed when the overflow should make the number longer. I was hoping to get away without. That turned out to be an easy fix, but it brought the total time to just over 15 minutes.\n\nbase = int(input())\ndigits = input()\nrevert = {n: each for n, each in enumerate(digits)}\nconvert = {each: n for n, each in enumerate(digits)}\nnumber = list(input())\npos = len(number) - 1\nwhile True:\n    value = convert[number[pos]]\n    value += 1\n    overflow = value == base\n    if overflow:\n        value = 0\n    number[pos] = revert[value]\n    if overflow:\n        pos -= 1\n        if pos < 0:\n            number = [revert[1]] + number\n            break\n    else:\n        break\nprint(*number, sep='')",

    "content": "Maybe I'm just having a bad day? This might be doable in 5 minutes with a focus on what actually needs to be done. But the discovery of what's needed only comes with the experience of doing it, no?\n\nFor a clash, you could simplify by leaving out the list of symbols. The base is at most 10, so just use digits 0 to at most 9. This should avoid a lot of unnecessary work, and make it much easier to think about how the increment needs to be performed.\n\nAlternatively, leave the symbols but fix the base, if not decimal then maybe octal for a tiny bit of a challenge. This would allow a strategy of converting the entire value to and from. In fact, this clash could coexist with the above.\n\nFor a classic puzzle, on the other hand, include bases longer than 10. Heck, include bases longer than 10 + 26.",
