    "content": "Since reverse is enabled I was studying the cases without the statement first - and had no clue at all. I think it is especially challenging to establish the pattern because test 2 does not really give a clue, test 3 and test 4 are impossible to use as a reverse player, so it's really up to only test 1 and 5 to establish the pattern. It might be doable, but it would not hurt if you include a couple more with <10 values for reverse players.\n\nNB once I read the statement and understood what needed to be done, I looked forward to coding up the solution - it is a nice challenge.",
