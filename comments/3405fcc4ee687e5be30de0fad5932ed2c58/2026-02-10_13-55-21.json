I was calculating the length of each arc at each vertex based on the angle created by the segments at the vertex. But obviously, this can be simplified. The angles should all sum to 2π, so the sum of all arcs should be the circumference of a circle with radius of 3m! What a dolt! All that effort for nothing! :-) Still a nice puzzle.

Can't think of a good phrasing in the context of the problem. Had this been a Christmas lights problem, I'd say \"The light strands can be plugged into one another, but you've only got one power source so the strands must form a single chain.\"\n\nTake my opinion with a grain of salt, I can't seem to be able to even solve the triangle case yet ^^'",

I added constraints for Xi and Yi and switch to feets instead of meters (Sharelock don't use metric system obviously)\n\nI don't think knowledge is an issue : convex hull is a common algorithm, and it's not hard to solve it without knowledge of these algorithm. Implementation is simple as well. I found many other CG puzzle more complicated or requiring more knowledge (graph, pathfinding). Maybe geometry problems are not common here...\n\n@player_one : thanks for the \"rewrite\" and you're experience is a good synthesis of why i designed this puzzle :-) , but he magic trick is a secret ... ;-)",
