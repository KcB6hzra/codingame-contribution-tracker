    "content": "Very cool puzzle! I think that this kind of puzzle is very doable in 15 minutes (I only needed about 7 minutes. (Without solving the problem codingame has with it's C language... but that's not part of the puzzle))\nAs Allis stated a couple of days ago, the directions '<' and '^' don't really change the puzzle because you have clearly defined the size \"of the space you are monitoring\" and explained handling of negative coordinates. The handling of collisions is not influenced by differently moving planes, so I think that four directions don't make anything more difficult. (I'd even say it's more interesting ;) )\n\nAnother thing (C_Boy mentioned this): I also would appreciate some more test cases for the additional directions, even though I personally wouldn't need them. BUT, others might need a very simple example with planes flying in four different directions. (So if you decide on using four directions, you might consider changing your first example to an example with four directions)",

The difficulty is probably more in how to implement a solution in a timely manner, but I think it is important to have clashes of various difficulty levels since the community of clash participants is varied in programming experience as well.",
