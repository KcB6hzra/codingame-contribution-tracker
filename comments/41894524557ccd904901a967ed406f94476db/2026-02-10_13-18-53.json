You mention \"x-axis\" and \"y-axis\", but the coordinates given in the inputs are in \"[[row]] [[column]]\" format, not in (x, y) format.\n\nFor example, the point 4 0 refers to the point at the intersection of the 4th row down, 0th column on the left. And that corresponds to 0 4 if rewritten in the (x, y) format (as you have written, x increases towards the right, y increases downwards).\n\nI would suggest to\n\n* Delete \"X axis increases towards the right | Y axis increases downwards\" (because that is implied from the positions of origin and bottom right corner).\n\n* Add \"The coordinates are given in the \"[[row]] [[column]]\" format.\" above \"The origin (0,0) corresponds...\".\n\nThanks again.",
