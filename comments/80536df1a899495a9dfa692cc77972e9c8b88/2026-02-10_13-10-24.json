    "content": "Nice challenge, but I think you should add another test/validator pair. The only one that currently has any digits in it is \"De Finibus Bonorum Et Malorum\". In Shortest mode it would be tempted to use Regexp \"\\w\" to replace the letters but this will fail on that test case because it matches the \"3\"s. It's best to have a test case that has digits or underscores too, so that clashers don't get 100% on tests and then 75% on validators.",
