Changed description, I made it more clear how to calculate the total score\n1b. The 2nd example was wrong, 4 + 8 + 10 = 22, final points should be 2 and not 4\n1c. Added some markup\n1d. Rephrased some sentences\n\n2. Better input/output description/constraints\n\n3. Changed an \"8\" in validator 3 (which is not possible according to the description)\n3b. Added some names to the test cases to help players identify what a test case is testing for.",

    "content": "Just played that one, and I really feel that I need to comment. \n\nFirst, about the statement. When you talk about the total score, just say \"The score is the sum of the card values, mod 10.\".\n\nThere is no need to add \"the total points is only in range[0,9]\", and there is even less need to add that other sentence that starts with something like \"... greater is than 9...\". \n\nYou only need \"The score is the sum of the card values, mod 10.\". That's it.\n\nThen your exemples can just have less text.\n\"Example: 8+4+2=14 mod 10 = 4\". No need for that \"recount after 9\" thing.\n\nAnd what about your second exemple? 22 mod 10 is 4? Is that a mistake?\n\nBut my biggest issue with this Clash, is the Validator 3. At the start of the statement, you say the card values are between 1 and 7. You repeat that in the constraints, which is nice. But there is an 8, just like that, hidden from everyone in one of the validators, which is really bad.\n\nI honestly don't know how that one was approved, without those things not even mentioned by the approvers.",

Is it a queen or a deuce ? It's not the same and so we don't know which value to attribute it until we realise it's the same as the queen which isn't there.\n\nExcept all of that : great challenge. But I won't recommend it unless you change these simple things. It's really a shame because it's great but you didn't take the time to really read what you wrote and see if it was correct.",

There's no \"10\" in your first example, how am I going to replace the 10 with zero? \n2) In the second example, there's a 10. If I replace it with 0, that should be 8+4 = 12, so that should be 2, right? \n\nSorry if I misunderstand something, but this clash seems good if you fix the statement. \n\nI don't want to reject this clash so I left a comment here for you. If you have fixed these issues I will consider approving your clash.",
