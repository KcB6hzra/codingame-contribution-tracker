    "content": "Very confusing statement, but the example makes things obvious. I would reword it as:\n\n\"Given a list of integers, pad each integer on the left with zeroes so that all integers have the same length. Use the shortest length possible.\"\n\nI think using [[f]] is unnecessary and actually a little confusing. I would remove it and only mention 0 ≤ length of integer ≤ 200 in the constraints. For that matter, it should be 0 < length, not 0 ≤ length. You also need a constraint on [[n]].",

It just makes it inconsistent. and the way it's written makes it even more confusing. I'd suggest you get rid of this special case and just print all zeros with the required width.",
