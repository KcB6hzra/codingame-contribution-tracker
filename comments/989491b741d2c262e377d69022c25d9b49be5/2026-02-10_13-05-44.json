    "content": "Interesting cool Coc, solved in python. In Coc, the length of the context might make some players take more time to understand. Some comments : \n- Is it to possible to add  before \"The rules to write a date in Latin are as follows.\" the following phrase : \"In Latin a date always refers to a special day\"  ? \nIt will make the all date /special day thing a little bit easier to understand\n\n- The formating of the special days made me thought that the \"i\" was a \"L\" as LUL.This tricked me. Maybe change it to an other word : \"Mul\"/\"Tul\"/\"Rul\"  \n\nOverall  cool CoC, it might be a little too long (~7min / 10min) but I think everyone can solve it under 15 min. This needs to be in the pool of CoC in order to have more than 1min of reflexion",

This makes it a little hard to read, but if you add few more words to the mini headings, I think it can clear this up.\n\nMy recommended revision to @ Goal:\nGiven a day number in July, write the corresponding date in Latin.\n\nThe rules to name a date in Latin are as follows.\n\n<<If it's a special day, you only need to print the name of said day:>>\n- July 1st --> {{Kal Iul}};\n- July 7th --> {{Non Iul}};\n- July 15th --> {{Eid Iul}} ;\n- August 1st --> {{Kal Aug}}.\n\n<<If it's the day before a special day, add {{prid}} before the day's name:>>\n--> {{prid}} [[special_day]]\nwhere [[special day]] is the name of the special day.",

    "content": "This took me about 8 minutes to solve, under 'Fastest' conditions. I see there's a rejection thread about this where you consider simplifying it by removing the Roman numerals. In my view that's not enough of a simplification to make this solvable under 5 minutes, since the conversion is quite simple when you give us a conversion table anyway.\n\nReally the complexity is just in understanding the concept and then figuring out the next special day and how many days away you are (\"d\") then applying the different conditions for d = 0, d = 1 and d > 1. It's an interesting idea, but it might be a bit hard for most clashers unless you can simplify the statement a bit more to make it easier to start coding quicker instead of reading.",

This might help me not only for this contribution but also for future contributions I make.\n\nIn particular, was the statement easy to understand or did you need to waste a lot of time reading it? Could you easily think of an algorithm to solve the problem? Did you encounter some difficulties while trying to implement this algorithm?\n\nI tried to make the statement as clear and concise as possible; and in fact if you follow the rules from the Goal section in the order I wrote them, it's already an algorithm:\n\n- Identify which of July 1st, July 7th, July 15th, August 1st is the closest special day in the future\n- Get the corresponding name (Kal Iul, Non Iul, Eid Iul or Kal Aug)\n- Get the difference k (number of days) between the current day and that special day\n- Add nothing, \"prid\" or \"a d <k + 1>\" in front of the name of the special day depending on k is 0, 1 or 2 or more.\n- k+1 has to be written in Roman numerals, but I gave the full list of Roman numerals in comment in the stub, so you can just copy-paste it as a list and retrieve the kth element.",
