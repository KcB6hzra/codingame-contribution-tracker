    "content": "I'm ok with leaving out Fastest for two reasons:\n\nFirst, the straightforward solution can be very short in languages like python or ruby. 5 short lines in Ruby, a couple of them being scope closers. So it becomes a competition of typing speed...\n\nSecond, the challenge is super simple, but the statement came out a bit convoluted. I don't want it to over-reward people who have a knack for (maths/logic) reading comprehension or that will just skip it.\n\nAs for the low value cases, I moved them down because they're kinda corner cases, I think 124 -> 60 is much more representative of what is expected. And it seems like you only get 1 \"out-in-the-open\" example in Shortest.\n\nStill, the other corner case (1) is available as a test, so it won't be an unexpected fail after submitting. And I think adding another single digit test would be too obvious for Reverse.\n\nIn any case, thanks for your feedback!",
