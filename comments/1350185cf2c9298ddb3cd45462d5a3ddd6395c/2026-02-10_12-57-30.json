I’ve tackled many logic puzzles in recent years, but the reasoning this one demands feels unique and especially satisfying. The visuals are sharp, the instructions are clear, and the difficulty curve is just right. With five test cases and five validators at the hardest level, the coverage should be fantastic for any algorithm. A great blend of logic and search for solving these magnetic boards!",

I always appreciate multiple test cases at the hardest level to really test how thorough I've been with my solution. However, I've looked at the names for a while now and they don't help me understand the difference between the test cases. They just seem like 5 Expert level test cases / validators to me.\n\nI'm solving everything except #21 100% with logic, so other than this one minor suggestion, I'm completely ready to go!

In my case the Impossible test case just happens to allow a quick solution for my backtracking algorithm (I got lucky) while the validator does not. \n\nWith logic added back in, nothing takes over 20 ms.",

The grid has just been rotated 90 degrees. The clues are all the same, but horizontal clues have been rotated CCW while vertical clues have been rotated CW. So, same clues and same board configuration, but clues are juggled ever so slightly resulting in completely different solutions. Brilliant! 💥",
