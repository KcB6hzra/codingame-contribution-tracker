I clarified this.\n\nThank you for your comments to improve this game!",

    "content": "Thank you for your comment!\nIt is pretty clear in the statement that the letters represent the column, but I can think of how to make it more obvious.\nUnfortunately, I don't have too much space in the statement since I wanted to make a French version and an English version (I find it unfortunate that it's necessary to write the statements only in English whereas the rest of the site is in French for me).\nRegarding the first 6 tests (well, 3 IDE tests and 3 validators), since the grid is invalid, the shot played by the sister doesn't matter, so I always put the \"simplest\" shot: A1. But I can change if it feels weird.\nFor the rest, I tried to vary, so we have: C3, G8, J10, A6, F7, E9, B2 and D4 :)",

It's in french for you on the official puzzles (not the community ones) because you did setup your account as french, but the community ones are usually only in english.\nAnyway, there is just one problem with your coordinates. Let's say you use (x, y), when you provide \"1 to 10 horizontally and from A to J vertically\" then x is supposed to be 1 to 10 and y to be A to J, but your validators/tests seem to use the contrary. Funny thing is all of them seem to work fine for both coordinates system except the last validator.",
