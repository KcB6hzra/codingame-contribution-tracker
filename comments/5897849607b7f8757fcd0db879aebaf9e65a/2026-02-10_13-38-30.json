I was the only one *stubborn* enough to code the whole thing.\nIt is incredibly boring. There is nothing at all to figure out.\nThe only reason to make such a puzzle is that it is easy for the author to make. There's no creativity, no challenge, no thought involved. It is only very time-consuming. \nExcel spreadsheet programming is more interesting than this.",

    "content": "There is no problem in programming I hate more than stringifying numbers. This can go so wrong at so many places that it's just insanse. If you make a type in \"thirty\", \"twelve\", \"eighty\", \"eight\" or \"fifty\" your validators fail and your tests pass. Does it make you a bad programmer? No. Does it make you angry? Extremely. The only way to test if this actually works is checking all numbers up to 99. And then still you will be probably mistaken as your eye won't catch small things.\n\nWorth calling out that in Reverse you don't get a statement so the whole problem is a leap of faith on what the largest number might be in the Validators.\n\nAnd lastly and this is my most important comment. Your problem assumes that everyone is familiar with the gramatically accurate way of writing numbers. And that is an unfair. Especially since it's not part of the problem statement.\n\nThese are not grounds for rejection but my opinion.",
