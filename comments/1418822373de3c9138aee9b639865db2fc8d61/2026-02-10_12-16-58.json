    "content": "Okay, so the main point here is that a supporting segment is not always an edge of the polygon, and an edge is not always a supporting segment. If you look at the puzzle image, it's maybe easier to understand:\nIn the example, DF is a supporting segment, as the polygon can be rotated and rest on the ground, with only D and F touching the ground. DE and EF are not supporting segments, because the polygon cannot rest on these edges (a part of it would intersect the ground). I'm not sure how to explain it in the statement.\nAs you said, the vertical projection is \"the orthogonal projection onto the line containing the line segment\". I called it vertical because in that case, the segment should rest on the ground, so the projection is orthogonal to the ground.\nThe polygon can \"stand\" on a segment when it stays in that position, and does not fall on one side. If ABCDEF is put on its FA edge (with C and D on the right), it will fall to the right, until D touches the ground, because the centroid projection on (FA) is not in the [FA] segment.",

The polygon can be rotated freely and then lowered until it touches the ground.\n\nWhen the polygon is resting on the ground, it may touch the ground at one or more of its vertices. A <<supporting segment>> is defined as a pair of vertices of the polygon such that:\n• Both vertices lie on the ground at the same time, and\n• No other part of the polygon goes below the ground in that position.\nIn other words, the polygon can be positioned so that exactly those two vertices touch the ground, while the rest of the polygon lies entirely above it.\n\nA <<stable equilibrium>> occurs when, in addition to being a supporting segment, the polygon remains at rest on that segment without tipping to either side. This happens when the center of mass of the polygon lies horizontally between the two vertices touching the ground.\n\nYour task is to:\n• Count how many distinct pairs of vertices form supporting segments.\n• Count how many of these supporting segments correspond to stable equilibria.\"\n\nYou can probably add in the example image imgur link as reference at the end of the problem description.",

From google search:\n\n\"Static equilibrium refers to an object at rest with zero net force and torque, regardless of whether it returns to that position if disturbed. Stable equilibrium describes a state where, if slightly displaced, forces or torques act to restore the object to its original position. Static is a description of motion (stationary), while stable is a description of behaviour under perturbation.\"\n\nSince there is the consideration of movement under force of gravity (i.e., falling over to one side), we should be trying to find points of stable equilibria.",

One detail: when resting on a supporting segment, \"the polygon can be positioned so that exactly those two vertices touch the ground, while the rest of the polygon lies entirely above it\" -> there can be more than two vertices, if several vertices are aligned (a reversed W for example). I'll try to rework the whole statement with the help of your explanations and the image.\nStatic vs stable: If I understand correctly, in the statement example, all equilibriums are static, because they can't be moved. They can be unstable, if the projection of the centroid lies exactly on one end of the supporting segment (but I did not tackle this problem in the puzzle).",

I did also notice the issue of when k>2 polygon vertices touch the ground at the same time, forming kC2 possible supporting segments. If this was not part of your test cases, you could consider including a separate statement in the constraints section.\n\nAs for the statement example, the polygon resting on the supporting segment FA seems to be in static equilibrium (since the polygon does not move, as you point out) but is not in stable equilibrium (as gravity will cause the polygon to fall should movement be allowed). Since we discount FA from the number of equilibria, I took it to mean that we are looking for stable equilibria. Do let me know if I'm misunderstanding the statement!",

In these cases, the supporting segment goes from the leftmost vertex to the rightmost vertex on the ground. To me, it feels quite obvious, as when you imagine the polygon being rotated, only one of these 2 points can be the pivot on the ground, but do you think I should clarify this as well?\n\nThe polygon resting on FA is not in a static equilibrium. As per Wikipedia, it would be in static equilibrium if the net force was zero, which it is not: the forces that apply (gravity and ground normal reaction) will cause it to \"fall\" on the right side, or more precisely rotate around F.
