    "content": "Good afternoon, \n\nIt looks good. I guess you can improve the text syntax a little. \n\n1) Usually, we do not put space before `:` in English. \n\n2) At some point, the text changes in format (\"With this process...\"  and \"For example...\".\n\n3) Just for learning, I see in the solutions you regenerate the list of characters. In python, you can use: \n\n```\nimport string\nstring.ascii_uppercase \n```\nIt is longer, but way faster: \n\n```\nIn [4]: %timeit [chr(i+65) for i in range(26)]\n1.29 µs ± 16.4 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)\n\nIn [5]: %timeit import string;string.ascii_uppercase\n81.9 ns ± 0.296 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)\n```\n\nAnyway, nothing critical. \n\n4) Based on the last comment, I wonder if you could also add the \"shortest mode\" to your puzzle. \n\nAnyway, good job!",

    "content": "Hello, thanks for taking time to write your comment !\nThat was very useful. Everything should be corrected.\n\n- The error case is now covered also by a test.\n- fixed the formula and the display overall. Everything should be formatted.\n- My bad for PGCD. This notation only exists in France. I wanted to say \"the greatest common divisor of a and 26 is 1\". However, I removed the complete sentence because I realised it could induce somebody in error since calculating the greatest common divisor takes, to me, a lot more time than simply testing  every divisor with a modulo. \n- I simplified some words to make it more accessible to non native english speakers and replaced words that weren't clear.\n- Most importantly, better banana puns and jokes",
