    "content": "Hi! Personally, I think your statement is a bit confusing, and I would reformulate as follow (it's only an exemple):\n\n\"\"\"Boxes are falling in a 2D vertical gridworld. Given a starting configuration, your goal is to compute the final state of the gridworld.\nBoxes are represented by the number {{1}}. They fall vertically as far down as possible through empty cells {{0}}. They can only be stopped by walls {{2}}, in which case they settle on the empty cell just above.\nIf there are only {{0}}s under a {{1}}, {{1}} will fall into a black hole and disappear from sight.\n\nThe matrix is always square.\nAs a special case, if the matrix is empty, print out {{-1}}.\"\"\"\n\nEXPLANATION \nFirst, the statement is a bit confusing as it use \"Box\" to figure an both an object within your gridworld, and a position or cell on the gridworld. Since box stand for two different concepts, you should distinguish the vocabulary used to describe them.\nSecond, the goal is not clearly defined in the first line. \"Find where the boxes will fall\" suggest that my output could be a list of the final coordinates of each box. It is clearer to state that what you want is the final state of the world overall.\nIn the same way, \"given square matrix\" is a bit vague as it does not exactly tell you what is represented and how. I would use 2D vertical gridworld, which indicate that space is discrete, only width and height considered, with standard top to bottom orientation. It simplifies understanding.\n\nHope this was helpful!",

    "content": "Goal section\n* Please write \"where boxes will fall\" instead of \"where will boxes fall\".\n* What does an empty box mean in terms of how it reacts to gravity? Or do you mean there is no box at that position?\n* Please change [[0]], [[1]] and [[2]] to {{0}}, {{1}} and {{2}} as they are constants instead of variable names.\n\nInput section\n* Please use either [[N]] or [[n]] - standardise the variable names.\n* Please change \"Space separated\" to \"[[n]] space separated\".\n* I suggest to replace \"which are the boxes with their types\" with \"({{0}}, {{1}}, {{2}}) which indicate the state of the boxes\".\n\nOutput section\n* Please rewrite as:\n<<[[n]] lines:>> [[n]] space separated integers which indicate the final state of the boxes.\n\nConstraints section\n* Please format n and b as variables.\n\nTest cases\n* I think the Tricky test should be duplicated as a validator, and Validator 9 should be duplicated as a test case. It'll be frustrating when a clash player has no idea of such edge cases and fail upon code submission.\n* I don't understand: if there are only 0s below a {{1}} box, does the box fall into a black hole and disappear from sight?\n\nThanks.",
