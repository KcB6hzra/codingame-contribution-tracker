    "content": "To reply to an old affirmation you made: the firefighter problem (which is a particular case of your problem, with all 1 in your variables or something like that) is NP-complete on bipartite graphs (and grids happen to be bipartite).\n\nI noted a few typos in statement_fr. Here they are:\nMissing space before colon \"cellules:\"\n\"paramêtre\" should be \"paramètre\" *2\n\"autant de valeurS\" *2\n\"elles ne sont ni brûléeS ni sécurisées\"\n\"tu ne pas pas\" should be \"tu ne peux pas\"\n\"les cellules déjà sécuriséeS\"\nAlso, you didn't translate \"The Goal\" and \"Rules\".\n\nI'm not sure about the fact that each cell has three parameters. As you say right after, all trees have the same parameters, and same for houses (and the code is written accordingly). I think it would be clearer with something like \"each TYPE of cell (tree or house) has 3 params\".\n\nAnd finally, I think the last part (rules) is a bit dense. Maybe you can split it in paragraphs; something like https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/can-you-save-the-forest---episode-1 (which someone already mentioned).\n\nI hope I didn't discourage you by saying all this; but I think these are minor improvements regarding what you already did, so you should be good! I'd like to see this puzzle to be published, and in particular to see the best scores of the community!",

I will fix that soon.\nAbout the starting fire, the fact that I ensure there is only one starting position is a choice I made in order to make the problem easier. I think it will enable us to find some strategies that would not work with several starting points (It is the case of the strategy I found). And we need these strategies in order to find a solution efficient enough, since it is an optimization game.\nAlso, by giving the starting position, it enables us to search the solution before getting the first turn input. It is the fire_progress that I consider as not necessary since it can be simulated, but I gave it for testing and debugging.",

I want to say that having a more advanced research bar would be better :p (looking for words in statement or at least tags). In order to support my puzzle, I will say the main differences are:\n- more parameters, in particular the fact that there are cells more valuable than others ;\n- mecanism of prevention instead of being limited to operate on fire ;\n- the fact that is is an optimization game make it more interesting I think. (And as suggested Konstant, we can even remove the success goals in order to focus on saving each cell).\n\nAbout the optimization goal, I believe there is no polynomial solution which will give an optimal result for all test cases one can imagine (I didn't prove that ^^ ). Then the question will be whether the tests I imagined are enough for that or not.",

But as you can see with the comments below, I removed it.\nThe main reason is that since it is an optimization game, it can be useful to compare some people who \"did the job\" for the same amount of tests, by comparing how bad are their remaining tests.\nAnother reason is that CodinGame expects us to stop the execution of a test when it is known to be a failure. In that case a player cannot see \"how bad a test is\" when not doing the job.\nFinally, the job to do for a test is quite hinted by the name of a test, or a player can easily guess it. Some test doesn't even have a target, as the \"homogeneous\" and \"random\" tests.",

    "content": "Well, why not. The one little problem I see in this case is \"balancing\" the tests. If someone doesn't block efficiently the fire on the test 03 with only 13 tree cells, he will lost only a few value, compared to another test with much more value. In other words, someone who fails the test 03 will be less penalized than someone who fails another test. Then I have to increase the base value of the tree cells in the test 03, and even balance the other tests. I will try to do that in the next days.",
