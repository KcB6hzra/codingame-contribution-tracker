    "content": "I like this clash suggestion.\n\nOne quick suggestion, \nIn Goal statement\n- line 1 currently mentions, \"There is a list of complete and incomplete words.\". While that is true, how about adding or rewording it to: \"Given a list of complete words followed by incomplete words\" for a better explanation of input, although Input section has the desired order mentioned.\n- line 3 mentioning \"Solve the incomplete words and output them.\" can better state \"Solve for the incomplete words and output their complete forms\".\nLast line can also have a blank new line separation for change of paragraph for clear emphasis.\n\nAlso, to add up to some difficulty of the problem idea, you might introduce a new case where incomplete words that do not fit with any of the given complete words are discarded from output. Now this is your decision to consider it or not.\n\nI'll just leave this comment for now, and will vote for contribution judgement after trying it out on IDE.",

    "content": "A fun idea for a clash! I would approve it if it's completed.\n\nHowever since this is a reverse clash, no statement can be seen. There is a possibility that the player (maybe its just me) would think there exist more than 1 solution by\n2\naaa\nbbb\n1\n___\nI would say maybe give a hint in a testcase (Might ruin the guessing part though)?
