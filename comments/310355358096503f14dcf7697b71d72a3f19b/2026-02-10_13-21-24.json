    "content": "This is a nice clash, but the statement doesn't really explain the assumptions well.\n\nFirstly, you assumed that Caps Lock is not on when the typing starts, hence why \"HELLO WORLD\" = 11, while \"hello world\" = 10.\n\nIt would be good to also explain that holding a key down for multiple subsequent keystrokes is allowed and only counts as one keystroke. Which removes the need for solutions based on toggling Caps Lock on and off. Holding down Shift gives the least keystrokes doesn't need to be stated, since it's quite a nice part of the puzzle to realise yourself, but it would be good to explain at least this much information.\n\nI'd suggest adding a Constraint like this:\n\"Assume that 'Caps Lock' is disabled when you start and holding down the 'Shift' key counts as one keystroke.\"",

I would advise to count the uppercase key as ON/OFF and not too count long-pressed SHIFT key.\nTherefore you should add to the description the following in my opinion:\n- When starting to type, the CAPS LOCK key is always OFF\n- Any key cannot be hold down manually through the different letters (exemple \"eee\" count as 3 times 'e' and not 1 long press of 'e')",

    "content": "Another assumption that's less obvious but confused me at one point in my clash of this, is that  you have assumed that every character needs a new keystroke, but for consecutive letters it's technically possible to just hold the letter down to save keystrokes. \"hello world\" could be 10 keystrokes in this way. Not sure if it's worth including a Constraint about that, but it can mislead people if they are debugging code with multiple wrong assumptions (mine ended up cancelling out for a while and leading me down the wrong path :P).",
