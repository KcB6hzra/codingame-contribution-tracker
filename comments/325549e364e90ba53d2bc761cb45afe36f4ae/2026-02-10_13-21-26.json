    "content": "Nice clash. Only thing I'd suggest is adding a Constraint saying:\nThere will never be negative integers in the string.\n\nI got this in Fastest mode and submitted really fast by ensuring I only summed numbers that existed as words with no non-digit characters, but then I realised after submitting that I would have failed any validator that had a negative number e.g. \"I think -23 plus 24 equals 1\" - my code would output 25 instead of 2.\n\nIt would be good to clarify that clashers don't need to worry about negative integers. :)",

    "content": "How can I understand that you mean only integer numbers and not other numbers?\n\nFor example, from your Goal statement, I could assume that maybe one of the valid test is like this:\n\n\"The recipe for cookie require 2 eggs and 1.5 kg sugar.\"\n\nAnd then I could spend time on int(2+1.5) and write longer solution in fastest mode, because short solution \"1.5\".isdigit() => False may seem not to work potentially (when I do not know if number means integer).\n\n1.5 is also number. If you mean only integer numbers, then you can either change word \"numbers\" to \"integers\" in the Goal statement or indicate in the Constraints section that numbers are integers. Otherwise, if you mean any numbers including floats, then add other test cases reflecting that and update solution to include float numbers.",
