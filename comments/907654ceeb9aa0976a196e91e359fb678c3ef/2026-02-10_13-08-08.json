    "content": "This is not currently a good reverse clash. The tests and validators are quite different and lead to issues.\n\nI just got this in a Reverse clash and got 100% on test cases with the below Ruby code:\n\nn = gets.chomp\nh = gets.to_i\na = gets.to_i\nN=second_name = gets.chomp\nH=second_health = gets.to_i\nA=second_attack = gets.to_i\nwhile [h,H].min > 0\n  h -= A\n  H -= a\nend\nputs h < 0 && H < 0 ? \"Draw\" : h < 0 ? N : n\n\n----\nBasically, I was seeing who would actually win in a fight between the two players assuming that each attacks simultaneously in turns until one or both of them died. This is a common solution for other clashes like this and when I got 100% on the test cases I assumed I had solved it, but then I got 60% on your validators. A Reverse clash needs to be clearly reverse-engineerable from the tests without ambiguity, otherwise it's impossible to know whether your code is correct or not...\n\nI think this needs to be corrected ASAP. I suggest swapping \"Greenskins vs Legions of the Damned\" with \"Monsters vs Legions of the Damned\", and then also adding a new test/validator pair that your code would consider a draw that wouldn't be under my code:\ne.g.\nName_1\n1\n10\nName_2\n11\n0\nOutput:\nDraw\n\n(My code would output Name_1, since Name_1 would win in a fight, but your code considers this a draw... which is quite inaccurate, imo, but if that's the way you want it then you need better tests to show it)",
