I feel there should be test cases where this approach should not work. It seems you picked the seeds of all test-cases to have the same low byte as one of the 17-cycle values of seed 0... Bad test case variety.",

With such an offset, the Empire can't encode its own messages. So of course it already \"cheats\" to actually encode, so of course it knows the cypher is weak.",

    "content": "I agree with everything Sam says below, the challenge is figuring out that the large number spaces don't need to be searched.  Also as he said, the statement that the message is XORed with a stream of random numbers is technically incorrect, it's xored with the bottom 8 bits of the random number.\n\nAs this is a well know way of breaking simple cyphers, I think it's an interesting problem, but for me I'd prefer making it clear that the problem breaks down to 7140 keys to check, and also making clear which possible characters \"The Empire\" can use in its messages.  I checked valid for ascii >= 32 <=126 but, I think the puzzle would be better if the characters used were made clear in the description (or even perhaps limiting  them to uppercase/lowercase/numbers and a single punctuation mark (.))\n\nI had fun and it took about 10 min in python to solve all the test cases.",

    "content": "This problem was not actually very hard once you recognize that there are effectively only 7140 different seeds since the modulo operator throws away all the other information when feeding forward to the next random number.\n\nGiven that, it is easy to try all 7140 possible seeds, select those that work for '@', and then ensure that if there is more than one unique answer, all the remaining characters decode to printable ASCII (32-126). It is still possible to have collisions but it did not happen in any of the test cases.\n\nOne thing that did not seem clear from your instructions: For encryption, in addition to XOR'ing the random number (in the range 0-7139) with the plaintext ascii code (in the range 0-255), you are truncating the result to 8 bits (0-255). That is not at all implicit and should be explained in the description.\n\nI'd say this is medium difficulty since the only tricky thing is realizing that throwing away the residual bits when feeding forward the previous random number means that the random number sequence must repeat every 7140 times (or less) and there are effectively only 7140 possible seeds.",
