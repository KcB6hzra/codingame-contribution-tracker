    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: Very nice reverse one! From the other comments I understand that it first had a description (I can imagine the challenge of describing this without making it too clear-cut), but as reverse puzzle, without description, it is a very unique and nice one. The different cases cover all different situations (so, I ran into a couple of errors along the way), and it gives that 'reverse puzzle' feeling because based on one or two of the test cases it is not yet clear, but based on all of them it becomes clear. Thanks for making this one!",

If yes, please state it as a constraint.\n\n* Please mention the lower limit of the length of [[s]] too.\n\nGoal section / Cases\n* More explanation is needed: rules about the order, letter case, how words should be classified into classes, etc.\n\nFor example, in the last validator, the expected output is \"My mother is a teacher\". \"My teacher is a mother\" is equally grammatically correct, isn't it?\n\nValidator 3: the expected output is \"I have no money at the moment\". One may argue that \"I have no moment at the money\" to be grammatically correct, though the meaning is absurd.\n\nSimilarly with Test 4: how about \"A mistake made you\"?\n\nThe rules should make sure that this clash is a test on programming skills instead of a test on English grammar.\n\nGame modes\n* I don't think Reverse mode is appropriate for this clash.\n\nThanks.",
