For example, Validator 1 introduces characters other than X, while the corresponding sample test does not, and Validator 3 contains spaces while the corresponding sample test does not.\n- I would put the form f after the string s in input - on shortest mode it's easier that way.\n- I think this could be valid for reverse mode :)",

    "content": "Hey!\n\nBasically it's a hard-coding prevention mechanism. During an actual clash, people will only see the tests. They get to run them as many times as they want to make sure they work. But when they submit their final solution, what actually runs are the validators, which are meant to evaluate the same conditions as the sample tests but with slightly different data.\n\nThis is so that if someone hardcoded the solution to a test case (say, if input is \"sAmMyJr\", return \"SammyJr\"), they get no credit for it. However, if the solution is not hardcoded, it is important that the sample tests accurately describe what will be actually tested in the validators, which is why they need to be similar. Otherwise you could pass the sample tests but not the validators and get a lower score than expected.",
