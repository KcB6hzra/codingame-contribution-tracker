The concept of \"observed\" and \"used\" was not clear for example.\nI had to manually go through the example to finally get it. \nMaybe replacing all \"used\" by \"discarded\" could help.\nAlso, the encoded message for the \"cat\" example could be : t+c+*+a+*+*\nIt would give a better intuition of what's going on.\n\nMy next concern is about the length of the encoded message. I think you should add it before. It will be very useful for languages like C.\n\nOtherwise it's a nice puzzle !",

    "content": "Just finished the puzzle. Thinking about it now, the new rules in the test cases isn't a bad idea, but just make sure to hint at it somewhere in the initial instructions. One small issue I had is that I think you need to specify better that there can't be any double spaces in between words. You do specify in the Output section that \"no string has leading or trailing spaces\", but this just sounds like you need to strip the spaces from the start and end of each line which led to me having a bit of trouble at first getting the decoding to work due to these double spaces that I thought were fine.",

I expect there is a temptation with a puzzle like this to just code it up, run it and expect to get perfect results...without ever reading the output. Only after reading the decoded output does it become clear what went wrong.  This is also why I added the requirement to print the decoded message on multiple lines.",
