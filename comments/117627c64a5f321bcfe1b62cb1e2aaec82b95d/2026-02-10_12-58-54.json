They are counted with their multiplicity.\"\n\nI think another stuff you can hide to improve our understanding would be a detailed example.\nSomething like:\n\"For instance, there are 3 integers which are less than or equal to 10 that have at least one beautiful base:\n- 4, admitting only 2 for beautiful base\n- 8, admitting only 2 for beautiful base\n- 9, admitting only 3 for beautiful base\n\nThe sum of all those beautiful bases is 2 * 2 + 3 = 7, so your program should output '3 7'\"",

    "content": "Hello, I'm glad to know that you appreciated this puzzle at its true value. Indeed, it is more difficult than The Most Beautiful Base puzzle because it requires performing calculations over a large range of values, which likely needs to be reduced to avoid a timeout.\n\n=== SPOIL ===\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy solution uses a sieve-like approach that allows me to reduce the search space by a factor of 1/2, by iterating through all potential beautiful bases (from 2 to √n). For each beautiful base, I compute all of its powers that are less than or equal to n, add them to a set to avoid duplicates, and increment the final sum by the base multiplied by the number of its powers that are ≤ n. This gives me an execution time of O(√n * log n).\n\nI'm curious to know how you approached the problem on your side.",

If you’ll allow me a few suggestions: replacing log10(n) / log10(2) with log2(n) would improve the readability of your code. Also, the min(n**.5, n**(1/qi)) in the second loop is unnecessarily defensive, since qi >= 2 implies 1/qi <= 1/2, which means n**(1/qi) <= n**.5. The condition if bi ** qi <= n is also mostly unnecessary. By using floor instead of round, you ensure that all bi^qi values are ≤ n and you also avoid some unnecessary iterations that you have leftover. ;-)",
