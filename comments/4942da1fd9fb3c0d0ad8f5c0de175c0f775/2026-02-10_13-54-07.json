    "content": "I've implemented it.\n\nI'm raising the alarm on the combination of the \"Hidden Files with -a Validator\" case with the sort ordering specification. It's the very only case in the whole set that doesn't pass using simplified ordering \"sort on ASCII codes, bit 5 flipped, ignoring dots\".\nI'd suggest:\n- swapping test and validator on this one (or provide an actual more in-depth sort ordering test), and\n- rewriting the sort ordering sentence\n\nProbable bug: \"Wrong File\" test/validator. This so much seems like it should be \"Wrong Flag\" I'll correct it myself, but do fix back if I'm the one who got it wrong.\n\nPersonal comments:\nI like the idea. I like part of the complexity. I like the fact there are a LOT of test cases that make TD implementation feasible. I like the fact this problem has improved a lot since it was first submitted, it makes it fell like moderation can be useful.\nI dislike the error handling. Not that I'm against having *some* of it, but it tends to either overconstrain the implementation to the problem setter's design, or summon warts over mine, so ugh. In our case, why report dir/file counts if there was an error? (rhetorical question: the answer isn't important, the fact the problem solver has to wonder is)",

    "content": "Okay. I have solved this. Here are my comments.\n\nPLUS:\n\n - There's more to this than I expected. Lots of little details to get right.\n - There's a LOT of tests that do a pretty good job of walking the user through the requirements.\n\nMINUS:\n\n - I don't think that it states anywhere that hidden files are sorted without the leading '.' character. My initial implementation sorted them high in the list because '.' comes before all letters.\n\n - Many of the validators contain a structure with \"gaps\" in the vertical ancestor lines. A good example is \"Hidden Files w/o -a Validator\". Only two of the (non-validator) tests contain a structure like this: \"Directory Flag Test\" and \"Big Test\". The first has only a single line with a single missing vertical, so it's not immediately obvious what's expected from that test. The \"Big Test\" is complex enough that it might not be obvious where the failure is in that test.\n\n - I don't think any of the tests contain a non-printed hidden directory. If someone implements their logic poorly, then only \"Hidden Files w/o -a Validator\" will fail.\n\n - I don't think any of the tests contains a file with a '.' in the middle of it (i.e. Final_Rendering.js). It looks like these are only in validators. If someone implements their hidden file logic wrong, then they might have validators failing for non-obvious reasons.\n\n - The \"-L -7\" flag in the validator is pretty nasty. My original implementation thought this was valid. It's an integer! I can foresee a lot of people getting tripped up by this, and no way to debug.\n\n - It's a common theme here, but in general the validators are quite a bit more complex than the tests. For example, \"Big Validator\" is much bigger than \"Big Test\". More and more, I'm becoming wary of validators that are noticeably more complex than associated tests. It opens up the possibility of boundary condition failures that can't be easily debugged.\n\nI like the puzzle, and very much want to approve it, but as-is, I still can't give it the nod. Please make some updates and reply to this message, and I will go ahead and approve it.",

    "content": "Duhh, first of all, yeah, that was totally a mistake about the \"Wrong File\" > \"Wrong Flag\" thing, I just saw the fix so thanks\n\nI think that, yeah, i'll just swap test and validator for \"Hidden Files with -a\" (plus it's much more appropriate to be a test than a validator, due to the possible \"bugs\" you can have on it with a \"bad\" solution).\n\nYeah, i was wondering about the sort ordering earlier today, and i think it needs to be more detailled, so yeah, i'm gonna edit that now.\n\nWell, I personally like to have to do error handling in my programs (well, i learnt to have to do it all the time), and, maybe i'm wrong, but i think more puzzles needs to have more of that.\n\nAlso, to answer your last question why \"report dir/file counts if there was an error?\", well, because the original Tree does. Like i said above in a comment, i originally created this puzzle to be the closest possible with the same behaviour as the UNIX tree (of course, with less flags).\n\nSo yeah, I don't really know which is best for exemple between no error handling at all, or this current one.. but i'll stay on that i guess\n\n(I'm new at CG puzzle and I know I'm not perfect (nobody is) but I think i need some time to be really OK with all this stuff :p)",

    "content": "Oh so close! Everything looks good except the \"Dots in Filenames Test\". It contains a hidden and a non-hidden version of Directory2. My code groups the files in these two directories separately. The answer groups the two together as if they are a single directory. If this is the intended behavior, then I think it should be documented as such, though I think that would be pretty strange since they are obviously separate directories in the filesystem.\n\nIf they are not grouped together, then it is undefined which one is sorted before the other. :-)",
