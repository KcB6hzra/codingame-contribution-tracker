Among others (maybe just one will suffice):\n\n- If the answer is 'No', how far did we get, i.e. what was the length of the longest chain.\n- If the answer is 'No', could we have done some substitution (maybe you could give the upper bound of substitutions allowed in the input) in the grid to turn this into 'Yes'.\n\n- If the answer is 'Yes', print some ascii of the solution. It may be sth like this:\n..........\nabc.......\nfedop.....\nglmnqrsz..\nhk...uty..\nij...vwx..\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n\nor this\n\n..........\nS-\\.......\n/-//\\.....\n|/-/\\-\\E..\n||...//|..\n\\/...\\-/..\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n\nIt doesn't render well but you get the idea. \n\nAnyway, those aren't probably the most exciting suggestions, but you get the point, \"Yes\" and \"No\" puzzles should be avoided.",
