    "content": "This problem is way too hard to solve without recursion in 5 minutes, but then the final challenge is too deep for recursion to solve.\n\nLuckily, your harder challenges are both cases were w=h, so you can use the 10000,10000 case to figure out a heuristic that when w=h the length is (w*w/2.0+w-1).round, but it's a very inelegant solution to use recursion and then a hacky formula. Looking at your solution for general cases, it's really not obvious how anyone could work that out in 15 minutes, let alone 5.\n\nI think this challenge would be better if the toughest test case was at most [w,h].max=8000 - as then recursive solutions are possible (at least in Ruby). Recursion is the smart way to solve this puzzle, but the extreme test case and validator make it fail.",

Alternatively you could modify the constraints to better reflect the real problem.
