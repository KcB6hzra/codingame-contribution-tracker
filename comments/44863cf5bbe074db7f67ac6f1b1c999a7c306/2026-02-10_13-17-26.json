    "content": "- Is Line 1 of the input necessary.  We are just scanning a line for space separated numbers.  We get the count from that.  I guess it helps a little since we can assume we scanned N integers but we can easily get that ourselves.  I didn't use N in my solution and neither did you.\n- The code was easily created to solve this in the time allowed.\n- Test cases all seem to provide coverage of the problem.\n- My only concern is that there may be other clashes very similar to this.",

    "content": "I see that you have raised valid concerns here. Thanks for your inputs.\n\n- Line 1 is good to have for languages like C/C++ where knowing the expected count of inputs makes it definite to take that number of inputs through a loop. Yes, it is unnecessary for most modern languages like Python that can just input().split() to capture all of the space-separated array in line 2.\n- Yes, I wanted to have a simple clash proposal that is beginner-friendly, so is solvable in under 5 mins. (A checklist point for clash approvers)\n- I've tried to keep strong and variety of cases, and these big cases were generated with random() function of Python (with some constant multiplier to keep uniform gaps), so hopefully are a good fit. Improvements are welcome for all cases. I hope I've got this correctly.\n- Yes, agreed. But maybe this one varies in testcases and somewhat on the expected output. And as per Clash of Code proposal of community guidelines https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/contribution-guidelines (see point 5 under General Guidelines), repetitions are relieved for CoCs, so maybe you may let this one go live to get picked for some clash with much lesser chances expected for a similar clash to immediately lead or follow.\n\nThese are my opinions for your points. Please use them for making you call now, and drop your vote if haven't already.",
