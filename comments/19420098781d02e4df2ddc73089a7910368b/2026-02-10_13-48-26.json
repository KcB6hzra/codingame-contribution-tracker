    "content": "Hi Wei-1,\n\nOverall nice problematic.\n\nMy skills in Maths, stats, and proba are a bit rusty but here are advice on popularization and a few questions regarding the process.\n\n1) A separator is not a Pupa, a Separator is between two consecutive Pupae.\n2) I think you can popularize ( - Weighted Entropy) as Score and ( - Entropy) as Group Consistency. \n\"\nWe look for the BEST separator between two groups A and B as the separator with the Highest Score.\nIts score is determined by the probability of a beetle to end up in group A (Pa) multiplied by the group A Consistency (Ca) + Pb * Cb\nConsidering the Probability of a pupa to belong to a Specie (Ps)\nA group Consistency is the sum, for each of the species in contains, of the probability of a pupa to belong to this species (Ps) multiplied by log2(Ps)\n\"\n\nBy the way, this second formula is not the Binary entropy function.  It is the Entropy function based on the Probability mass function.\n\nI assume you compute Pa as follow:\nfor Na being the number of beetles in group A and N being the total number of beetles:\nPa = Na / N\n\nHowever I don't get how you compute the probability of a beetle to belong to the Specie S (PS).\nI would naturally go for Ps = Number of beetles belonging to S / N\nBut it clearly set the horn length as useless. I think something is missing for me to be able to understand the method. (and I come from a scientific background...)\n\nI think if you want a 10Yo to get it you need to lay each step you use to resolve this (here Probability computation missing for me) and describe the step without any technical world.\n\nI tried my best to replace entropies but I am missing the understanding of the next step to be able to popularize it.\nGood luck !",

    "content": "hi Wei-1, I admit I join hoeskioeh ... even after the rephrase I have no clue about what is expected from the reader after reading it for the first time.\n\nI understand the concept of binary tree, but I don't get the idea about entropy and binary separators. I wonder if this is suitable for an easy puzzle. Maybe for a difficult one, and I would suggest to explain with more details these sentences :\n\n- The binary tree is created by a series of binary separators : what is a binary separator ? \n- The equation how we choose the pupa to be the separator is binary entropy. And we find the best separator in the group with its corresponding weighted entropy. Explain binary & weighted entropy\n\nThe picture with equations, even with a solid math background (OK, 18 years ago ...) was difficult to relate to the text.\n\nI'm also fluent in Scala, and reading the solution didn't enlighten me yet ...\n\nI'm afraid that in the current state this would be very discouraging to most coders.\n\nI'm curious to learn about these concepts though ... Maybe a suggestion : could you rephrase the subject without refering to entropy at all ? Or if this is core to the problem, maybe explain more the equations \"for a 10 years old\". How do you use these 2 entropy functions ?",

Suddenly we get a value for \"class\" which isn't even part of your explanation.  \n\nYou throw around too many unexplained and undefined words. Give no easily accesible example, which can be retraced through your description...  \n\nTry to explain it to a 10y old. Take a small example and run through it step by step.  \n\nA reasonably easy approach to shaping it into a story is finding a good analogy. Maybe a newborn river, trying to find its way to the ocean. Flowing down a hill with bumps of different sizes or something...  Or sorting apples into baskets and trucks or something.  \n\nBut help me understanding the puzzle:  \nYou get a set of \"points\" with two attributes (value/class). Then you sort them into a binary tree, until each leaf contains one point. All nodes in this tree are a decision, a separator, like [(value>=x)] where all points with value<x are to the left side of the branch, and value>=x on the right.\nThen output the number of nodes.\n\nStill don't fully get the \"class vs value\" part",
