That is what I do in my solution.\n\nIn the end I feel that those who go and search for conversion algorithms to copypaste end up having a disadvantage rather than an advantage.\n\nIf you and others feel differently though, maybe I could change it to shortest only instead of fastest, so copypasters' disadvantage would be definitive.",

That is why 36 has one (XXXVI). 38 would have two (XXXVIII), 338 would have three (CCCXXXVIII), 883 would have three (DCCCLXXXIII), 208 would have one (CCVIII), etc.\n\nI understand your assumption, but as @shuhu pointed out it's part of the \"ruse\" on the player: the idea is to reward thinking with your brain rather than your fingers.",
