    "content": "This game has become one of my favorite exact cover puzzles of all time. It seems like the game would fit the normal CodinGame input/output model better than the solo game format, but then we would lose the graphics. It took me a while to be comfortable with this, but I got over it. The graphics make these games so much more engaging than traditional puzzles and I am now 100% supportive of the game model, even for this type of input/output puzzle. \n\nI initially built my logical, problem space reduction step by step. I was thrilled with the test case design. I was only able to pass one more test case each time I submitted new code and the test cases perfectly led me to the next idea. I made it a long way with logic, but then I got stuck. I still have a more ideas for a completely logic-based solution, but I opted to add backtracking.\n\nThis puzzle touches on just about every Algorithm X topic in my playground. Again the test cases perfectly guided me as I built out my AlgorithmX subclass and added functionality for multiplicity and row/column checking.\n\nA little debugging quickly brought my logic approach together with my backtracking and here we are. Another outstanding solo game! Great job @VizGhar!\n\nI have no suggestions for any of the associated text. This game appears well-scrubbed and ready to go! As for difficulty level, I found it quite a bit harder than several of your other puzzles. A case could be made for the hard end of medium, but I would lean toward hard. My overall experience with the game was most similar to my experience with There is No Spoon - Episode 2.",

    "content": "Constraints\n* 2nd constraint: Please change 10 to 6. (Originally I wanted to suggest \"min(10, size)\" instead, because markers cannot exceed the grid size, but 6 should be sufficient.)\n\nLogo in the viewer\n* The word \"Battleship\" can still sit slightly higher (around 5 pixels).\n\nReferee\n* For your info only: the error message \"Expecting ${testCase.size} lines representing the solution.\" seems never to appear.\n\n  • When I output too few lines, I only got a Timeout error.\n\n  • When I output too many lines, the console still displayed only `testCase.size` output lines. If those were correct, I passed, and the extra lines were ignored.\n\n* No winning message is shown in the console after passing a case.\n\n* Could coordinates be added as an optional feature, displayed when hovering over any cell in the viewer? If that's too complicated, you may combine coordinates with error tooltips as a single option.\n\n* Question: Could the error messages shown in the viewer also be displayed in the console? Alternatively, perhaps append \"Refer to the error details by hovering over the cells highlighted in red in the viewer\" after \"Invalid solution :(\"?\n\n* For the \"Seaman\" case,\n\n1. I first tried this output:\noo....\n....o.\n..o.o.\n..o.o.\n..o..o\no.....\n\nThe 4 cells (2x2) at the top left corner all displayed \"Diagonal adjacency detected\", even though that isn't the case.\n\n2. I then tried this output:\nooxxxx\nxxxxox\nxxoxox\nxxoxox\nxxoxxo\noxxxxx\n\nI output o / x where it was x / o in the original grid. The error messages for those two cells were correct. But visually, they looked the same (circle in a square), which feels a bit confusing.\n\nShouldn't the final grid in the viewer reflect exactly what the player outputs? If the viewer also needs to indicate the original o's and x's, maybe they should be visually distinguished. If that's too complicated, just showing the player's output supplemented with error messages should be sufficient.\n\n* For the \"Surround-whole-boat\" case,\n\n1. I tried this output:\nxxxxxx\nxoooxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\n\nNo error messages were shown in the viewer.\n\n2. If I replaced any of the o's in the above output with \"x\", I got this error: \"Conflict with the original testcase: expected </#/>, but found x\". In fact, the expected value there is \"o\".\n\n3. I then tried this output:\nxxxxxx\nooooox\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\n\nCells that were actually correct (note) were flagged as incorrect, while incorrect ones weren't flagged.\n\nNote: By \"correct\", I mean the cells matched the expected output, but they were interpreted as middle segments instead of bows/sterns in the player's output. It's probably more confusing to treat that as incorrect.\n\nIt would be clearer to:\n\n  • Mark the genuinely incorrect cells as incorrect, and\n  \n  • Introduce a new error message indicating that those ship cells are touching bow/stern cells from the original grid.\n\nThanks.",

Here is my suggestion:\n\n  • The representations differs depending on whether the player's solution is completely correct or not.\n  \n  • When the player's solution is not 100% correct, each cell is drawn in 4 layers (from bottom to top):\n\n    1. Grey background (instead of white)\n    \n    2. Wavy line pattern (dashed and/or solid) filling the entire cell to represent the sea\n    \n    3. Hollow circle (dashed or solid outline) to represent a ship, regardless of whether it's a middle segment or not\n    \n    4. Red overlay to mark an error\n    \n  • The solid wavy line pattern shouldn't be too dense, to avoid visual overload. It should look something like this:\n﹏﹏\n﹏﹏\n﹏﹏\n\n  • Dashed elements indicate information from the initial configuration.\n  \n  • Solid elements indicate information from the player's configuration.\n  \n  • Superimposed solid on dashed of the same element (circle on circle, waves on waves) = agreement between the initial and the player's configurations.\n  \n  • Dashed circle on dashed waves or vice versa = inconsistency with the initial configuration.\n  \n  • A red overlay is then applied to every cell where the player's configuration doesn't match the expected configuration.\n  \n  • When the player's solution is completely correct, the display can switch back to the existing style: use solid (filled) circles and partially rounded squares to represent the ships.\n\nThanks.",

It feels like the battleships are being exposed as we correctly identify their positions.\n\n* The sea cells look good as they are, so I don't think adjustments are necessary. That said, I'm open to seeing your tweaks in case they improve things further.\n\n* I agree that the error highlights should be made a bit more transparent.\n\n* The placed ship cells being smaller than the dashed outlines looks fine to me, especially on larger grids where everything scales down.\n\n* In the initial configuration, \"<\" and \">\" are shown as \"◗\" and \"◖\" in the viewer, so they appear flipped in the wrong directions. Refer to Frame 0 of \"Surround-whole-boat\" for an example. For comparison, \"^\" and \"v\" are represented correctly.",

    "content": "Good job; the graphics look much prettier now! I think it would be better to switch back to solid lines instead of dashed ones for the initial configuration, since the current colours already make them distinctive. An initially configured solid-line sea/ship icon would also be clearer when overlaid with a player's ship/sea, especially on large grids where icons are small (the current dashed version looks a bit unclear). Alternatively, you could consider using denser dashed lines.\n\nIn addition, as suggested by Timinator, consider upgrading the difficulty level of the puzzle to Hard.\n\nHope you've done more testing in general!\n\nThanks.",
