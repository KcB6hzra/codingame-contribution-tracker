I have made the required updates, including:\n\n- Added payout information since it was missing\n- Changed the order of the last two tests so that there is not a new \"requirement\" (0 is not even) introduced in a validator. This is generally frowned on.\n- Update all the tests to state EVEN and ODD\n- Update your sample solution and retested with it to ensure that everything still works.\n\nWith these modifications, I have voted to accept this puzzle.",

    "content": "@player_one much better, thanks!\n\nYou missed some PAIR/IMPAIR translations in the constraints section.\n\nAlso, I have to say, wording as \"the payout is *parity*\" in a sentence that already contains the words EVEN and ODD is extremely confusing.\n\nI'd suggest expanding one of the 35-to-1 or 1-to-1 with what happens when you win or lose on those (bet how much, win or lose how much, net change), if betting games detail aren't too much. Main reason being: ther eare no \"unit\" test cases: all of the behavior is hidden in long lists, so someone who isn't familiar with how betting games work (and I wish there to be many) isn't going to have a chance at understanding why it's going wrong.\n\nPS: any clue about the 1-2-4 numbering in the input section?",
