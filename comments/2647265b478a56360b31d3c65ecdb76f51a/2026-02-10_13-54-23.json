But poker players might miss it; I'd include its omission as a note)\n\nIMHO, the current constraints aren't. WinningPlayerId is an output specification; the card ordering is an integral part of the problem statement.\nWhat *would* be a reasonable constraint is that the hands are well-formed (i.e., mostly, no duplicate cards).",

    "content": "Okay. So I took the time to go through and solve this one today. It's a fun puzzle. I have a few comments / suggestions, though.\n\n1) I guess I'm not an expert on Holdem. I didn't realize that an Ace can be low for the purposes of a straight. You make passing mention of this in the last sentence of your statement, but it's not at all obvious. I think this should be spelled out more clearly.\n\n2) Related: The description of STRAIGHT_FLUSH states that it has no Ace. This is not strictly true, since it can contain a low ace, and in fact Test 4 expects a straight flush with an Ace in it.\n\n3) There are no tests or validators that expect either a PAIR or a ROYAL_FLUSH. You can code a solution that passes all tests and validators but never detects a ROYAL_FLUSH situation.",

    "content": "Thanks for the feedback - very helpful.\n\nGood spot RE: the straight flush with the low ace. The code and tests are correct, the Statement is incorrect. I was trying to condense/simplify the statement into minimal words and chose a poor description for that one.\n\nRE: the validators, I agree that it's possible to pass with an incomplete solution, but isn't that always the case? I'm unfortunately limited to 8 tests/validators. My thinking was that I didn't want to introduce anything 'new' in the validators not already seen in the tests, e.g. imagine if you failed due to Ace-Low straight but in a validator with no feedback - that'd be hard to spot/fix. So I've focused on capturing the trickiest scenarios to make a good test for someone having an honest/complete crack at the problem, rather than being comprehensive on the hand types. I would expect for example that any solution capable of determining which straight is best would find pairs or royal flushes easy to distinguish.\n\nDoes that make sense? Given that, would you rather have complete hands covered, or as-is?\n\nEDIT: Statement has been changed.",
