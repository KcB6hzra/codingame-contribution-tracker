    "content": "Nice idea, and the statement is very well written :-).\nSome remarks about style:\n— use backquote ` (to get code formatting) around block of equations, and spaces around +-=, it will be clearer:\n`1+2+3=6\n1-2+3=2\n1-2-3=-4\n1+2-3=0`\n— use double scare-bracket [[]] around variables N, x and n to get variable formatting\n— perhaps choose two different letters instead of N and n, e.g. N and M, it would be less confusing, especially during a CoC with time constraint and stress!\n— change 50>n>=0 to 0<=n<50 to be consistant with other constraints.",
