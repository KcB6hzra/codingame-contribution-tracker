    "content": "I took a while to understand the problem. I would suggest to place first paragraph after the second paragraph. I also like to reword to make it short. Here is the suggested one.\n\n\"\"\"\nDNA sequence is a double helix consisting of 2 strands. The genetic letters are A, C, G and T (Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Thymine). These letters always connect in pairs between the two strands of a double helix. A with T and C with G, which means if you have an A at position x of a strand, then you must have a T at the same position of the opposing strand.\n\nThe DNA sequence has to be repaired by <<replacing all occurrences of a bad gene with the good gene>>. The output has to be the repaired DNA sequence.\n\n...\n....\n\n\"\"\"\n\nCan we remove the following sentence? When you say valid it means DNS sequence is already correct and no repair needed. This confused me.\n\n\"The inputs are always valid DNA sequences containing only the four genetic letters A, C, G and T. There are no test cases checking for invalid inputs.\"",

    "content": "Thanks for the feedback. You are right, strand2 can be (easily) deduced from strand one, so I thought why not provide it to make the task a little bit simpler.\n\nAbout your example with \"AAA\". The following is not really important, but I'd say it is interesting ;-) A genetic word is always made-up of three letters (triplets/codons). There are 4 different letters , which means the genetic dictionary contains only 64 words. There is 1 word that says where a sequence starts, 3 words that say where it ends and each of the remaining 60 words will be translated into a specific amino acid in a polypeptide chain. So, my thinking was, that a repeair sequence will always be one or more words (triplets/codons) and thus this specific scenario with AAA and AT as a repair sequence should not occur. Also there is no test like this, so it should not be a problem.",
