Only critique is that you need to specify that you need the output in ascending order (or accept arbitrary order outputs).\n\nFor fun, I was thinking about the case with large N. We can do Gaussian elimination with bitsets to find a basis for the set of solutions in O(N^3/32) with any number of liars, but I think it's exponential time to pinpoint a solution with the given number of liars.",

    "content": "Nice puzzle! The explanation helps. \n\nIn its current shape I think it's a pretty good fit for medium, but the max size of 10 seems a little easy. If you are careful to only guess the combinations with valid number of liars instead of all possible permutations, you can have 42 people with five liars, and that's less than a million guesses.\n\nI was trying to figure out if there was a way to write a logic solver that could make deductions like \"if 1 is a liar iff 2 is a liar\" or \"2 is a liar, so remove all 2 from statements, updating T/L if needed\". Eventually though, I couldn't find a way to search through enough statements without including a catch-all statement with all the people, and then the solver walked through a sizeable fractions of all 2^N possibilities. Maybe I was missing something, but letting N go up to a thousand could make an interesting Hard puzzle.",

But this implies that 2 is also a liar because 1 > 2 = T is a lie. We have two liar so 0 cannot have told the truth in the first time so 0 is the liar.\" I don't think my text is perfect, but i think it's a good idea to had something like this to help understand the puzzle. I don't know if this is a big hint for the resolution, it may be the downside of my proposition.",

Someone could answer \"2 1\" to test \"A width beginning\", which would be correct according to the statement but rejected by the platform.\n\n>I didn't use ABC because each NUM is different\nThat's my point. Each NUM is different, so use different variable names. Right now, we have to assume and guess that they match by ordering, when it could be perffectly explicitly clear at no  cost.\n\nYour correction makes a \"creative\" use of the word recursive.\n\n>> The meaning of being a liar is kind of vague too\n> No it isn't.\nYou don't get to decide that :)\nI actually gave you a specific example.\nIt's off-topic to the statement, but the kicker is it's impossible to tell at that point in the statement.\n\n>> Yet that doesn't happen.\n>And ? Is that a problem with the puzzle itself ?\n>Plus, I've specified \"you CAN\", which doesn't mean it actually occure.\nIt doesn't make the statement *wrong*. It makes the statement *bad*.\nConstraints are there for a reason: they determine what class of algorithm can be used. Lying about it is morally wrong.\nThen again, that part was before I got to fully understand the NUM/NUM ambiguity above, so it may not be as off as I thought. I'll measure when I'm in the mood to solve.\n\n>You seam very upset\nI'm not quite sure what makes you think that.\n\n>if you have some trouble, please tell me !\nThat's literally what the comment was about.\n\nAll in all, your statement as a whole suffers from the \"hindsight\" problem: all (well, most) of the information needed to solve is there, and it's trivial to verify *after* it's been solved. But it does a bad job at getting the reader to reach that ah-ha point because of all the ambiguity hurdles in the middle.\n\nIMHO, you ought to write up a complete explanation of the example's resolution.\nBTW, the very first test case is the one blessed by the platform as \"the example\". Use that one for clarifications unless there's a good reason not to.",
