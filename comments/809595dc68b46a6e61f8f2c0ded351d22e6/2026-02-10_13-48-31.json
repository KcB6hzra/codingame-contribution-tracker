It would be nice to have a test case involving a number like this so that clashers can debug this before submitting overly-shortened code.",

    "content": "Good little puzzle with a small catch, since not everyone will get that the hour hand in rarely exactly on the hour position. Maybe a hint on this in the text should be considered, or a picture of an analog clock at 12:30 in the example text.\n\nBut I don't think that the puzzle works for reverse mode. It would be very hard to figure out that we're dealing with clock hands and angles on an analog clock based on the input/output alone - and the math is not easily discovered without that knowledge.",
