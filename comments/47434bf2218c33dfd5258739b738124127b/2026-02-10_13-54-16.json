    "content": "I like it! Well set, no blatant bug, interesting! Upvoted!\n\nSolved. Good job on the short codes test, I had a bug there indeed!\n\nI noticed a typo or two in the text, I'll edit that tomorrow if I think of it.\n\nRequests (for approval): there's a trend to require actual test names, even for the validation cases (cf https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/validators-poor-information-ongoing-issue/2011). You might want to edit them, even if it's to copy the test case name.\n\nSuggestions:\n- don't quote your constant strings in the problem statement: the formatting is enough to distinguish them.\n- you initially ordered the sounds click/clack/clock. it's surprising to order the assumptions of \"correct digit\" click/clock/clack.\n- IMHO, cluck would sound better than clock\n\nTrivial Haskell plea: would you mind capitalizing click/clack/clock so I can trim 8% off my solution's line count?\n\nNote: I didnt have to make use of the \"all attempts were unsuccessful\" information. Now sure if that's relevant of anything, or would still make for a sensible puzzle.\n\nCrazy thought: what if NO solutions is possible?",
