    "content": "Cases\n* In some pairs of cases, the names in the test all consist of a single word only, but that's not the case in the validator. For example \"Priscilla Presley\" and \"Barack Obama\". \n\n\"Presley\" and \"Obama\" may fall into the category of \"extra information just as FYI, in case you need it for your Tabloid story\", but well, it's also a bit confusing. After all, \"Presley\" and \"Obama\" are normally considered as part of the names.\n\nFollowing the principles of\n• easier cases appear first, more difficult cases later, and\n• each pair should have similar coverage,\nI would suggest to rearrange the input strings so that\n• no FYI information is tested in the initial pair(s)\n• FYI information is tested in the subsequent pairs\n\nGoal section\n* Following the above comment, I would suggest to mention that if a name consists of more than one word, only the first word is considered.\n\n(That raises another question: Can the name before {{and}} consist of more than one word?)\n\nOutput section\n* Please format n as a [[variable]].\n\nConstraints section\n* Please move \"In Couple-Names, only the first letter is capitalized\" to Goal section, as it is an output requirement, not a constraint.\n\n* Maybe add a constraint that each name in the INPUT always starts with an uppercase letter and does not contain any other uppercase letters?\n\n(e.g. \"Linda McCartney\" is a possible name in the input, but \"McCartney Linda\" isn't... Or can such names be tested? Take care not to contradict \"In Couple-Names, only the first letter is capitalized\", though.)\n\nThanks.",

(The 2 over-lapping lettters are \"en\").\nThat is not acceptable since it violates the \"Must contain at least one letter from each person, that isn't part of the overlapping-letter(s).\" rule.  Ben's entire contribution would be just the overlapping letters (\"en\"). (Poor Ben)\n\nWhereas Vanessa plus Zac = Vac because \"a\" is the only overlapping letter.  So Vanessa contributes \"Va\" ( which is more than just the overlapping letter) and Zac contributes \"ac\" which is more than just the overlapping letter).\n\nIf you can think of any rephrasing etc that I should add, please tell me.",
