    "content": "Nice contribution.\nHowever I believe you should change some of the terms in the statement as they are not technically correct.\nFor instance you cannot have a \"chord\" with two notes, let alone one. You could however say it's a series of notes, as in a melody for instance.\nThen I believe the verb \"transpose\" is closer to what you are asking than \"modulate\", (although technically still not correct since you have to take en-harmonics into consideration.)\nIt's mainly just nitpicking but I fear it could confuse those with knowledge of musical theory.",

Quite the opposite actually :) \n\nMusic thoery is too much not respected here for that :) You cannot call that \"transposition\" from a musical perspective. C E  +1 would have to be Bb D (or possibly C# E#). C# F cannot be a transposition of C E.\n\nI am not sure what is the right term to use, though. But not a musical one for sure if you do not want to confuse peuple with knowledge of musical theroy.\n\nBut nice simple coding exercise !",

    "content": "Yeah I did not want to dwelve in the complexities of enharmonic equivalences, which would be a whole other story in terms of difficulty. But I think the most problematic thing was the use of the term \"chord\" which has now been corrected.\n(Chromatic) transposition is in fact what is asked in the statement but indeed the output does not conserve the original interval, which I would not expect for a clash anyway.\nOne way to get around this is to assign a unique name to every key of one octave on the piano and then speak only in terms of piano key shifts instead of semitones, but would this be any less confusing for musicians?",
