The puzzler still needs to think about probability and how to capture those probabilities, which was a valuable exercise for me. I'm now interested in learning the math, but I might need a version II that forces me to learn the math. :)",

They decided to go with an ant, I don't think it's a big deal.\n\nAs for the edge, I've worked with the outcome that ending outside is the same as ending exactly on the edge. That is it takes exactly one second for each step, if you end outside (border included) of the anthill, you're done, the ant found the food. \n\nI see how this could lead to confusion. One could think that in an anthill like this:\n+-+\n|A|\n+-+\nwith step 50, it would take the ant 1/50 seconds to reach the food, which makes sense, but it's another problem.\nHere, we are like checking with a cronometer the ant at every second (integer seconds, forgive the repetition). If it reached the food we stop our clock (this is equivalent to say that it doesn't matter if it reaches the exact border or it goes outside).\n \nI could add this clarification to the statement:\n-> if the ant reaches the food, it remains there eating until the end of the second. \n\nOr maybe just more clearly:\n-> The ant reaches its food if it ends on the border of the anthill or outside the anthill. \n\nWhat do you think?",

The source in French is in the solution. It is a bit long, but only some parts of it are really necessary. \n\nRandom but relevant question, can you do matrix inversion in php?",

    "content": "The ant will eventually, given enough time, leave the anthill. The problem is asking you to find the expected value (espérance) of the amount of time it takes the ant to leave the anthilll. We are not talking about singular, concrete happenings, but the weighted average across many repetitions.\n\nYou can also think it this way: we play a (possibly very long) game with a balanced coin, where I pay you 1 euro if it lands heads and you pay me 1 euro if it lands tails. How many rolls does it take on average until one of us reaches 5 euros?\n\nYou should see now that your remark is not a counter-argument. It would be the same as to say, but hey, there are cases where we could roll tails and heads consecutively 1000 times. Yes, but that is extremely rare, and would contribute very little to the expected value, which again, it's just a weighted average. Plus 1000 times is just a small number, remember that we never stop until one of us reaches 5 euros!\n\nEventually, given enough (possibly a lot) of time, one of us will reach 5 euros.\n\nAnd probability theory tells us that if we play this game many many times, and we write in a paper the number of rolls it took us, the average of those numbers will yield the expected value (which I have no idea what will end up being!). \n\nI hope my explanation was clear enough, if it wasn't feel free to ask anything.\n\n-----\n\nAlso, here is a gif for the ant moving around a 22 x 22 square:\nhttps://github.com/daxida/CodinGame-contributions/blob/main/markov-ants/gifs/gifs/image.gif\n\nThere are 220 frames so it took the ant 200 seconds (the 20 last frames are just the animation of the end)\n\nYou can download the generator and visualize many random paths that I hope will convince you that you always reach the end.\n\nThe folder also has the necessary bits of markov-chain theory to solve this puzzle (a very beginner-friendly presentation, and some references). The presentation is in English, but this is in French: https://idpoisson.fr/berglund/probamass_html/node18.html",

    "content": "This is very relevant and I don't know what to do about it. That was one of the reasons that this puzzle was on hold for so many time. \n\nI'm as convinced as you are that almost nobody will do the maths over the simulation because you first need to be aware of the theory (no matter how many \"Markov\" hints I may place around the puzzle), and then you need to work with a language that lets you do matrix inversions in codingame, which as far as I know, it's like python and ruby.\n\nI posted it somewhere else, but in case you want to give it a try to the theory, here are some slides by a friend of mine:\nhttps://github.com/daxida/CodinGame-contributions/blob/main/markov-ants/Tran_presentation.pdf\n\nI tried to address this by making this other puzzle (https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/652263f52fba00673b2fb8aa2c888e8a27024) that you could only solve with this bit of theory, but I think it's too hard even for a very hard (as in, it is ridiculously specific)\n\nMy stance is that getting to the point of being at ease with the theory enough to be able to solve this and the other puzzle deserves a hard-very hard label. And the simulation part of this one is more of a easy-easy medium one.\n\nIt's not hard to completely rule out the simulation, a some more decimals of precision should suffice.",
