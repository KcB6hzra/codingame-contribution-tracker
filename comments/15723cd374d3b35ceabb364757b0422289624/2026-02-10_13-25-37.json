    "content": "I would like to approve the contribution, but there are two points that I find problematic.\n\nSuggestion: replace the term \"average result\" by \"average of the lowest and highest value the dice can roll\".\nSuggestion: either unify the type of the answers (require the decimal point .0 even when the answer is an int) and specify type float ; or make clear in the Output section that the result should not have a decimal point when it is an integer. Or you could maybe even make the dices odd, to force the result to be an integer. That would solve the floating point problems.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe first is, as previously said by some comments, about how the 'average result' does not clearly signify that it is computed as (<high>+1)/2. The formulation is clumsy, as I think you use \"average\" as a synonym of \"mathematical expectation\". An average is generally defined on a series of values/samples. Here, what you want is the notion of expectation, the average over an infinite amount of dice rolls. \n\nThis is a problem, 1) because it requires mathematical knowledge that isn't directly linked to programming ability, so generally unfair. 2) because there is no values to explicitely average. The coder must look at the test cases and deduce that the notion you refer to is the mathematical expectation, or more simply the average of the lower and higher dice result.\n\nFor the second suggestion, it is simply a case of formating not being completely specified outside of the test cases. Also, rounding floating points isn't an exact science so caution is advised.",

I really appreciate it.\nI made a mistake on the \"-\" processing (bad copy-and-paste).\nJust a remark: I was surprise not to found any output in the auto-generated code. Isn't it the usage to have somme dummy output so that we understand what fonction we should use (ex: console.log() rather than console.error() in JavaScript) ?\nOn a side note, I would love to see an evolution of it, perhaps as a classic puzzle, where you have to compute the number of occurrences of each outcome (so that people understand that 2d6 is not the same thing than 1d6*2).",

Note that the * modifier is not cumulated with + or - modifier\".\n\nAlso the first line is not used when we know that we just have to split with space. Maybe you keep it for C, I don't know.\n\nFinally, I often see that we have to round the result, maybe to prevent floating number that can be displayed differently depending on language. Maybe we should have to round or floor the output.",
