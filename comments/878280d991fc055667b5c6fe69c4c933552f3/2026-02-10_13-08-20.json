    "content": "This is a cool idea, but ultimately very hard to solve in a clash. I ended up getting 85% after almost 13 minutes (had 100% on test cases). I came first with the other 3 human clashers all getting 0% and one bot getting 42%.\n\nI think your statement has a typo or lines out of order. It currently says:\n\"Point attribution per group:\nA, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A\nJoker\"\nThen it goes and describes the points per group. It seems like that list of cards followed by the Joker is out of place and that was very confusing in my clash...\n\n\"Joker and group points 2\" is the only test/validator that tests for consecutive 2's necessarily implying one is a joker. I ended up getting 85% because I didn't consider that possibility. It might be good to have a test case with two consecutive 2's.",
