The first parameter is never used in most languages. The question boils down to the fact that you either know how to print an array/list/anything from first index to last, or you don't. That is like taking an exam in history... Pointless.",

I'm not even doubting the creator of this exercise is intelligent person, with high ranking and a very good understanding of programming.\n\nBut I still don't think you can learn much from this. Either you know a solution to this problem or not. If not, google one, copy a code which makes this no feel like the joke about what a software engineer does. In the end 99% of the people learnt nothing. I think every contribution should raise the bar of quality.\n\nAnd lastly, I did not reject, nor downvoted the contribution, because I strongly believe that the contribution and the creator put in a lot of work for this, all I'm saying, that before hitting approval/reject, we should consider pros and cons. Hence I strongly support the first paragraph in the guideline.",

    "content": "While I do agree that most players likely learned nothing, in the shortest mode it might actually help some players learn. A few days ago I had a clash with 3 other good players on this one in the shortest mode, and the result was a fairly close one (40 vs. 44 vs. 46 vs. 47, all using Python3). In Python3 the probably shortest solution is like this:\n\ninput()\ns,*r=input().split()\nprint(*r,s)\n\nThis solution actually makes a good use of the star operator which many players are not familiar with. Even for good players, most of them can only come up with sth. similar to the provided solution here using print(*v[1:],v[0]). So I think they definitely learned a bit.\n\nMeanwhile, some other languages offer a  built-in rotate method, which could also be helpful for the shortest mode and make those who might not know this aware of it.",
