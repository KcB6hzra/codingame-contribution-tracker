    "content": "Thank you for following up! 👍🏻\n\nI think the default number of case pairs (4) is often too low, allowing some code to pass all author-created tests and validators while still failing in other scenarios. Increasing this to 7 to 10 pairs strikes a good balance: not too many, but enough to enhance testing vigour, provide more cases for players to test out their code, and offer additional hints in a Reverse mode CoC.\n\nMay I suggest one small change in the cases? In\n• Math (test) and\n• Math Validator,\nchange the output to \"Nothing to process\", and also change the input accordingly (e.g. 10 * 2 * 3 = 60). The purpose is to cover the scenario of a longer string with \"Nothing to process\", which is not currently covered in any cases.\n\nThanks again.",
