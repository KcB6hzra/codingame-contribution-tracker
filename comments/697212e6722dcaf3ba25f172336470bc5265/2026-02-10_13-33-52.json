    "content": "I'm not convinced this would work well in Reverse, especially not with these test cases. For that, at the very least, I would add some shorter test cases at the beginning, but even then I'm not so sure if it would be less obscure.\n\nHowever, I agree that the constraint is too small, in a straightforward solution, you iterate through the input once and calculate the new position in each step, which is essentially a simple O(n) algorithm.",

    "content": "Ah, I hadn't realized that CG supported such large inputs. I increased the length to 4096. I don't find any value going much further though, because I would need several orders of magnitude more characters to get timeouts.\n\nI had considered including Reverse before, but I felt that many people might trip up on my choice of letters. On the flip side of things, if I added an extra 3 or 4 simple test cases, it feels too much like handholding, which defeats the mystery behind Reverse for me.",
