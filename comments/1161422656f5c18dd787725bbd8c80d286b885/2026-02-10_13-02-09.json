    "content": "Thanks for taking the time to respond.\n\nOf course, '£' is still single-byte.  And I DO understand where you're coming from... but I believe I have some pretty strong arguments that may well change your mind.\n\nArgument 1 :\n\nThe template code assumes single-bytes... and allocates space accordingly.\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < Y; i++) {\n        char ROW[X + 1];\n        scanf(\"%[^\\n]\", ROW); fgetc(stdin);\n    }\n\nYou'll note that the template code overflows the memory allocated for the string... and that should NEVER happen!  The template code (On an EASY puzzle particularly) should be expected to be valid and error free.\n\nWorse.  This template will appear to work, but will corrupt other variables - leaving a newbie with absolutely no idea where their code is suddenly misbehaving.  It isn't ... it's the template corrupting the stack frame.\n\nSubtle errors caused by memory corruption from the supplied code is, I'd argue, NOT something a newbie should be dealing with on an EASY puzzle.\n\nWould you agree?\n\nArgument 2 :\n\nI have completed every 'easy', almost every 'medium' and a fair number of 'hard' and even a quarter of the \"very hard\" ... and this is the first time I've come across ANY unicode.  I can attest that it is the only EASY that throws unicode into the mix.\n\nNow, that wouldn't be a problem if the task was specifically unicode related.  But, when it's not, then it's just a needless tripwire.\n\nBut I'm not against unicode.  I actually think a unicode-based puzzle would be a good thing... as it's a vital aspect of real-world coding.\n\nArgument 3 :\n\nThere is no 'balancing' argument I can find, in favour of '§' over 's'\n\nIf we consider the issues, including the invalidation of the template code... I think it's almost impossible to make a compelling case for '§' as opposed to, say, 's' which would fulfill the same purpose - within the context of the puzzle and the specific skills it purports to test.\n\nSo, I'd argue that it's ALL downside... with no redeeming purpose.\n\n\nHaving said all that...\n\nI do agree with you that unicode is something that every coder needs to understand... but I posit that it would be better to introduce unicode handling in a challenge where handling unicode is the stated task.\n\nThrowing random unicode into a challenge that is not explicitly unicode focused, is just an unnecessary tripwire for new players.  Especially when it causes data corruption in the template code.\n\nI'd argue that, on 'Easy', the supplied template should, at least be valid!\n\n\nPersonally, I find the above arguments pretty compelling.\n\n... but have I convinced you?\n\nIf not, no worries.  We're all friends here and I'd still buy you a beer!  : )))))",

I've changed Line 4 of the stub accordingly.\n\nArgument 2: There may be more than you think; here are some easy puzzles with non-ASCII input:\nhttps://www.codingame.com/training/easy/what-is-your-garden-worth\nhttps://www.codingame.com/training/easy/benfords-law\nhttps://www.codingame.com/training/easy/by-train-or-by-car\nhttps://www.codingame.com/training/easy/six-degrees-of-kevin-bacon\nhttps://www.codingame.com/training/easy/tabloid-couple-names\nhttps://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-alien-business-of-cows\n\nThere's even one easy puzzle requiring non-ASCII output:\nhttps://www.codingame.com/training/easy/nature-of-triangles\n\nArgument 3: I agree, but it's the author's design choice. Ultimately argument 3 won't hold if argument 1 doesn't hold.\n\nI won't claim to be an expert in the area of non-ASCII characters, but I do have some experience with it. I was the one who asked CG to fix the console last year. Before the fix, the console didn't always display non-ASCII characters correctly, and I would be one of the reviwers to request authors of contributions to remove any such characters. As mentioned in my previous comment, I found it surprising that CG couldn't support such a fundamental feature properly.\n\nNow that it's been fixed, it's a new chapter for CG. There still aren't many contributions featuring non-ASCII characters, so I appreciate you pointing out the issue with the code template. This helps me understand potential pitfalls better and improve future contributions accordingly. 😉",

    "content": "Wow, I can't believe I'd forgotten about those contributions.  Thanks for the correction.  I've been here way too long and my brain is getting way too smooth.  I think I'll be getting put out to pasture soon ; )\n\nI think we can draw a distinction between unicode input and unicode output.\n\nUnicode output is something that a beginner can 'paste in' from the statement, since the UI permits it.  The fact that it is unicode won't necessarily be a problem.\n\nprintf(\"🍓🥒🌿🌹\");  // This output 'just works'(tm) ... even in crunchy old 'c'\n\n\nBut I think multi-byte input poses a significant challenge for the beginner.  You cannot getchar a '🍓' ... and getting into properly setting locales and switching the template to wide characters is a hurdle for the beginner... moreso when the default template appears, at first glance, to work as intended.\n\nPerhaps it would be nice if  'setlocale' and  'wchar_t' were a part of the template on such unicode input puzzles, as it gives a stronger (see: valid) place to start.\n\nBut, I'm certain that throwing a single non-graphical unicode character into an ostensibly ASCII-looking input, is perhaps just a little too opaque and is likely a recipe for frustration.\n\nPersonally I'd suggest :\n\n1. Unicode output... great, it's pretty and it's fun!  Let's have more of that : )\n\n2. Unicode input should serve a purpose and it's use should be obvious and explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.\n\n3. The automatic template generation should perhaps be more robust, and detect when when the supplied tests and validators contain multi-byte characters on the input - so that the templates themselves don't become a trip hazard.\n\nBut I yield to your experience.\n\nThanks for the correction, and for entertaining my little geriatric tirade in good humour ; )\n\nHave a wonderful day o/",
