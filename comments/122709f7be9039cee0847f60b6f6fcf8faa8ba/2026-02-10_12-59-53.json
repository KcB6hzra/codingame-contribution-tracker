In total not very difficult, though. Was able to solve it in less than 10 minutes in Perl (and no, I didn't peek at your solution; though I did afterwards and realized that I could have simplified my solution by using a border of spaces around the map; I did it differently).\n\nMaybe you should make it clearer how to output the distance. You need to use \"1 league\" if the distance is one, \"[[n]] leagues\" if more than one. Otherwise the reader might think it should be literally \"[[n]] league(s)\" always.",

    "content": "I personally think all BFS puzzles should be categorised as at least Medium difficulty. The Easy category seems more appropriate for straightforward tasks involving basic string manipulation, conditionals, loops, and similar concepts. That said, since some BFS puzzles have already been placed under Easy, I'm not insisting on reclassifying them.\n\n@Harry.B., it's ok to change the difficulty to Medium without breaking anything. The difficulty part of the url to a puzzle is just a filler and can be changed to anything, e.g. the following url works:\n\nhttps://www.codingame.com/training/insanely_difficult/road-to-mount-boom\n\nAs for the current puzzle, @PatrickMcGinnisII, did you use PHP for your solution? I solved it in Python before @Harry.B. simplified the large maze case, and even then, I didn't find it particularly challenging. One trick I used, which I often rely on in other puzzles too, was precomputing the neighbours. I went straight down that path so I don't know whether it helped the code performance or not. But that might be worth trying if you haven't already.",

When i tried storing the actual path as it searched it timed out, too many copies.  looks like maze is different now, 2 otherss have done it in php as well now.  bfs stack and queue methods both work now.  I counted how many steps and how many elements left in queue.  In order to make large maze validator work...i swapped the start and dest so it started more internally and that solved the original validator timeout.  Now i guess the maze is changed...any/all simple searches will work.  I guess the next level would be that Brodo's dwarf friend could tunnel thru 1 mountain. ha.",
