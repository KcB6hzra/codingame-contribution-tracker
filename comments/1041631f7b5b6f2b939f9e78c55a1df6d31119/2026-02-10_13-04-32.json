    "content": "It wouldn't hurt to include a little more explanation in the problem statement:\n\n\"For example, [[n]]={{20}} has two prime divisors, 2 and 5. The smallest integer with two prime divisors is {{6}}, with divisors of 2 and 3.\"\n\nEven being an obvious statement, it might have helped me solve it in less time to be illustrated so clearly. My solution was correct, but more involved than it needed to be. And as a result, it took me longer than 5 minutes.\n\nBut I say this primarily for those who are staring at the puzzle with their head spinning. The problem is so concise that the meaning is going to be lost on some people. If they downvote, it will get yanked. Trust me, I've been there!",
