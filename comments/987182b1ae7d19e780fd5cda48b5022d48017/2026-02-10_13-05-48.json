Just got it in Fastest mode, and all the answers submitted by the clashers were different!\n\nI chose to have a number_of_slimes variables, a number_of_hits variable, and at every iteration, I divide h by two while incrementing number_of_hits by number_of_slimes and doubling number_of_slimes.\n\nAnother Clasher chose to maintain a list of slimes.\n\nAnother Clasher used the same recurrence relation as you to write a recursive function,\nreq(h) = 1+2*req(h//2).\n\nAfter submitting my answer to the clash I thought about it some more and found a more explicit formula: the number of hits required is the next power of two minus one.\nk = 1; while (k <= h) { k <<= 1; } print(k-1);",
