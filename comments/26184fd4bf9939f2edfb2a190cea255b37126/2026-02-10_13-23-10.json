    "content": "Small suggestions:\n- \"Go evaluate\" validator could handle case where remaining point becomes negative somewhere in the calculations, but at the end remaining points becomes positive - which is still \"Go evaluate\". There is only one test (visible for a developer) which handle that so can be hardcoded ;)\n- 1337 school is a common expression in English? If not and it is a name of a specific school, I think it could be in an apostrophe\nApart from that - good job!",

Can they be merged be some way?\n\nInput section\n* Please add <<Line 1:>>, <<Line 2:>>, <<Next [[n]] lines:>> to the beginning of each description respectively.\n* For the third description, please mention that they are strings, and operations will be either {{EVAL}} or {{PUSH}}.\n\nOutput section\n* \"Go evaluate\" is not mentioned anywhere in the statement. Please move this requirement to the Goal section and explain what you mean by \"weren't able to push at a certain operation\".\n* For this section, write this instead (explanation may be omitted here after it is moved to the Goal section):\n<<Line 1:>> An integer for the remaining evaluation points, or a string {{Go evaluate}}.\n\nCases\n* Tests and validators should be different.",
