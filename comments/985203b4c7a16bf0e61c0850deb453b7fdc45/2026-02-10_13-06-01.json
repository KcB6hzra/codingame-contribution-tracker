    "content": "I guess reverse would be fun. I just had it fastest, and it is a quite long story for basically checking for any occurrences of vv or ^^ - while I still have no idea what I actually did.\n\nYour solution code seems to grasp the details you meant with this clash. However, it can also be solved with removing all spaces and | from input, and then looping by two and saving any vv or ^^. That gave me 100%, but I have no idea how it relates to your statement story (which sounds rather interesting).",

Upvoted.\nSuggestion: One may want to specify that the solver has to print the orbitals which violate the principle from left to right, e.g. in test 4, the answer is ^^ vv ^^ vv ^^ instead of other permutations.\nReverse mode: In fact the solver does not need to know anything about atomic orbitals when solving - they just need to know they will output all occurrences of ^^ or vv. So I think its not as hard as stated below..?",

Isn't that an \"unfilled space\", which should be marked by an underscore instead?\n\n* Please change \"signs (if\" to \"signs. If\", and then \"ignored)\" to \"ignored.\" with a full-stop. That's a main rule and shouldn't be put inside brackets (which seem to denote secondary/unimportant information).\n\nInput\n* Aren't the orbitals separated by {{|}} instead of spaces?\n\nConstraints\n* Just leave the section blank if there are no constraints.\n\nThanks.",
