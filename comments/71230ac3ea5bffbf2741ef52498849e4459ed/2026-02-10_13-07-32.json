    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: Had fun with it, it was nice !\nThe logic of what to do isn't hard, and is well explained, but as someone who doesn't play chess it took me a little bit more time than i care to admit to get the coordinates right ^^\" \nA bit confusing for a coder not familiar with chess positions, we are pretty hardwired to have rows number 0/1 at the top and the bigger the number,  the lower the row. But in the case of chess positions, line 8 is at the top and line 1 at the bottom :')\n\nSo for me a bit unnatural but nowhere near a hard difficulty. Once you get used to it you have multiple ways to deal with it pretty neatly.\nOverall, great job, was easy enough to grasp, not too difficult and with a twist in the array management that made it interesting !\n\nI instantly upvoted it and waited a bit to be sure I wanted to approve because it took me more than five minutes, but I do like clashes than can be a little longer, and it's definitely solvable in less than 5 :)\n\nSolved in C++",

I could rotate the board to the 'black' side, but then h1 would be the top-left corner and the columns would be backwards \"hgfedcba\", so either way something is 'backwards'.\n\nI'm glad you were able to get past that and solve it. I was tempted at one point to just use (0,0) style coordinates, but I think using chess notation makes it more interesting.",
