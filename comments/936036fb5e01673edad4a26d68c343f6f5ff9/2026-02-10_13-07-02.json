    "content": "Very nice and original, thx.\n\nAbout the last constraint (\"word\" is never the last etc) maybe you can:\n\n- Either suppress the end \"if word appears only once in trainingData\", because there is no such a testcase even when word appears more than 1 time. This is the simplest.\n\n- Either ask to print \"FOLLOWED BY NOTHING\" (or other mention) with the percentage when the word is followed by a \".\" or at the end of the trainingData after substitution of chars /[^A-Za-z\\.\\- ]/ by \"\" (maybe this regex is not completely true). This may be too difficult in 15 min.\n\nAnyway, clearly an upvote for me, and approbation for soon",
