    "content": "I really like the contribution. I have 3 comments:\n1. Gautzilla is right about the clarity of the question. Reading the example and test cases explained the problem easier than the statement.\n2. There should not be a case for \"0<=\", because the statement does not explain what constitutes a 0-length sequence. For instance:\n\"abbc\" with \"0<=b<=2\" with the logic of your test cases would equal 1. But actually, there are more instances of \"b\" repeating at least 0 times: \"a\", \"bb\" and \"c\". With this ambiguous behavior, not explained in the statement, the solution is a bit more complicated to debug.\n3. The inequality strings should only list \"<\" and \"<=\", as no \">\" is used in the test cases nor in the proposed solution.\n\nI would be delighted to upvote if these comments are taken in mind.",

    "content": "1. I definitely agree with others to keep just 1 question per test case.\n2. It took me a while to figure out, what I was supposed to do and that I had to parse questions in FORMAT \"2<c.length()<5\"\n3. Maybe I was tired or my string/regex operations are rusty, but I haven't even managed to parse the question \"2<c.length()<5\" to get correct boundaries and letters in the 15 min mark. Maybe I was overcomplicating my solution, I don't know. Simplyfying to just 1 question per test case might help a bit (with statement clarity), but it still might be a bit hard to solve in 15 mins (for some).\n4. The statement says there can be inequality sign even \">\" or \">=\", but there are no test cases for these signs. Either add them to a test case or remove them from the specification?\n5. I suggest to reword somehow this weird sentence: \"The character specified is always a single letter of the alphabet, but the number of consecutive letters is specified.\"\n6. Are we sure the test case \"Test 2\" is correct? There are 3 consecutive series of letter a, with length: 2, 6, 2. The question asked is \"2<=a.length()<=5\". This means only two of these series are compliant with this requirement, no?\nI'm sorry, but as of current state, I don't recommend this to get out. But after some tweaks, this could be good :-)",

    "content": "I think the puzzle is good, but IMO the statement is very misleading:\n\n\"This question asks you to count the number of characters in Strings S.\": that's not true. the task is to count how many sequences of a given length and a given character occur in a given string.\n\n\"Integer n times, the number of characters is asked.\" : n isn't the number of characters but the number of questions asked. This may not be necessary tho, maybe sticking to 1 question per test is enough for a clash.\n\n\"For example, if Strings is abcccdecc and Integer n is 1, Suppose that the question 2<c.length()<5 is presented.\" this is not easy to follow because of the integer n thing, I think it would be better without it : \"For example, the question 2<c.length()<5 is presented for the string abcccdecc\" would be clearer.\n\nI'd be happy to approve the submission if the statement is revised!",
