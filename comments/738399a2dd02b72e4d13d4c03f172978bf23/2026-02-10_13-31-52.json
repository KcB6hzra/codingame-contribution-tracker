    "content": "This clash is not good enough to be allowed in Reverse.\n\nSimply coding for ans = x*15.71/5 gives 100% on the test cases, but then only 50% on the validators.\n\nThe validators are too hard compared to the tests, they should be matching in difficulty.\n\nValidator 4 in particular is 120 times larger than any of the tests. I think I'll have to edit this manually, as it seems like the author is not active anymore.",
