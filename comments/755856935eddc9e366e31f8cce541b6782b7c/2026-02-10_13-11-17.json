    "content": "Statement:\n66,66666666667 is confusing, I'd suggest just saying instead that \"1.5 tokens is one word\". You also use a comma here but you use \".\" as the decimal separator elsewhere and a comma as the thousands separator earlier in the sentence \"per 1,000 tokens\".\nYou seem to round to 4 decimal places, but you never mention this in the here or the Output section.\n\nOutput:\nYou seem to round to 4 decimal places, but you never mention this in the statement or here.\n\"invalid Model\" is an abnormal capitalisation of words, I'd suggest \"Invalid Model\".\n\nTests:\nYou re-use the same msg across multiple tests, it would be best to use new ones, but you can keep each pair of test+validator similar like 5DN1L said, just have new messages as the pairs progress.\n\nOverall:\nIt's a good clash. Once these issues are fixed I will approve. :)",
