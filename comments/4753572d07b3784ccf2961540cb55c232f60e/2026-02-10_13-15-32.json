You cannot leave that out, otherwise how are the players supposed to know how to identify the relevant lines?\n\nAt best you can add a clarification that the specification may differ from actual usage. Alternatively, add additional test cases to cover the situations you mention. But either way, you still have to write a bit - for the latter case, you would mention that INSERT can appear anywhere in a line.",
