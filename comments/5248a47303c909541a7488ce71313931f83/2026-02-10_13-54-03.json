    "content": "Better.\n\nWhat I feel is missing is ordering of the following events:\n- your inertia changes as a result of the track slope\n- you move to the next track element\n\nExample 1: you come to a _ with inertia 1. So your inertia goes to 0. Does the trolley stop in place (since its inertia is now zero) or in the next place (since it came here with positive inertia, it's got to move, right?).\n\nExample 2: you come to a /‾ with inertia  10. Do you reach the plateau on the right and stop there (since you arrived with positive inertia), or do you reverse in-place, wait for a moment with inertia 0, then go down?\n\nBoth of these sum up as: does the inertia  change occur \"on\" the track elements, or \"between\" the track elements?",
