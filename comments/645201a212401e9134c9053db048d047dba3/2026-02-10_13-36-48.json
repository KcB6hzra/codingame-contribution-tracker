I would add at least one more test case (split test 4/validator 4 into two), because currently there is no validator with multiple consecutive digits and no visible test with 0s. To make it solvable in reverse mode you might want to add even more. Also the stub generator is missing write command.",

It should be removed or put on another line.\n- You are not multiplying 'numbers' but digits. It would be way more complicated to look for numbers.\n- What is the product of zero numbers? For me its 1, not 0. It should be stated explicitly.\n\nSo the Statement would become:\n@Goal\nGiven a sentence 's' multiply all digits present in 's' and add the number of words in 's'.\nWords are separated by spaces.\nThe product of zero digits is 0.\n\nThat said, I think this is a cool classic clash of code :)",
