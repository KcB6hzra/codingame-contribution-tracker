    "content": "Can you please clarify in the output that an output is required for each of the lines? (e.g. \"[[N]] lines: per input line, the number that is the result of adding all ...\") \nI am not sure what went wrong while I played this clash, but I somehow did not manage to debug between having to find out that multiple lines were required and that it was not capital sensitive. And, I ended third of eight while having 0% on the validators, so I guess other had a problem as well.\n\nYour current statement actually suggests only one output ('print the result'), but in reality multiple outputs ('print the results') are required.",

    "content": "1. Please add a space after \"conversations.\"\n\n2. Please change \"that uses characters\" to \"that uses digits\"\n\n3. Suggest changing \"adjacent\" to \"similar\".\n\n4. Suggest changing \"all the numbers\" to \"all the digits\" (in both Goal section and Output section)\n\n5. Suggest changing \"string gotten in parameters\" to \"input string\"\n\n6. Please fix the typo \"lenght\" to \"length\"\n\n7. Please change \"normal strings\" to \"strings\" in all sections - it's not clear what makes a string normal or not, and also, some input strings are in leet speak!\n\n8. It's a bit confusing as the title talks about \"LEET\" being converted to \"1337\" but \"L\" is not actually mapped to 1.\n\nIn addition you have used \"such as\" in the explanation, so it seems to imply that the list of pairs you have listed is the full list.\n\nWould it be better to revise the wording a bit?",
