The statement for a clash of code should be as concise as possible. (Of course, the second paragraph will then have to be adjusted a bit.)\n\n* I suggest to move the formula to a line on its own for clarity.\n\n* Similarly for the example.\n\n* The formula used by CodinGame rounds *down* the XP required, instead of rounds *to the nearest* integer. Please correct the description, your solution code and the cases.\n\n* Suggest to emphasise that the formula gives the total amount of XP required to collect, instead of the additional amount of XP for each level-up.\n\nCases\n* Make sure there are edge cases where using a simple rounding and a rounding-down makes a difference in the output.\n\n* Make sure there are edge cases where the the XP collected is exactly the amount given by the formula (both (a) exact, as for levels 4, 9, 16, 25, etc., and (b) rounded down, as for other levels).\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "Thanks for your feedback! I changed the following things:\n\n- I changed the first paragraph to something shorter. If this is still too long I can also cut it entirely.\n\n- I tried to improve the formatting of the formulas according to your suggestions\n\n- I changed the description and the test cases to round down instead. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like the official codingame example (3^1.5*10 = 52xp) actually rounds up, but I can confirm that the actual algorithm rounds down.\n\n- \"the formula gives the total amount of XP required to collect, instead of the additional amount of XP for each level-up\" -- I think I don't quite understand what you mean.  As far as I understand, the formula ((level ^ 1.5) * 10) gives the amount of additional XP needed to level up one level, not the total amount of XP required to reach that level. For example, I'm currently level 21, so I need floor((22^1.5) * 10) = 1031 XP, this is also what codingame shows me.\n\n- I think the existing test cases already cover rounding down (e.g. the first IDE test and validator)\n\n- The existing LEVEL UP test case already covered exact levelling up with rounding down, but I also added another LEVEL UP test case that would also pass with normal rounding\n\nAlso, is there a way to see already accepted contributions to check for similar ones? (i.e. how did you know that two similar clash of code puzzles already exist?)\n\nThanks.",
