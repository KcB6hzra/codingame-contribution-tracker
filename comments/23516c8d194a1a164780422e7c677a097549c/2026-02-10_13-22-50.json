    "content": "* Your goal statement is incomprehensible. I saw you were working on it, but I'll give you an example of a (imo) clear explanation. \n\n\"You need to decrypt the given text [[hidden]]. Every two numbers get converted to one character as follows: convert the first number to its name, and take the character with as index the second number. The two numbers correspond to that character.\n\nFor example: the number pair 23 would be converted to a single \"o\" (Format this as constant. I forgot how.). First we convert the 2 to \"two\", and then we take the 3rd character in that word: \"o\". \"\n\nI changed your example, because having two times the same number only adds to the confusion.\n\n* The example in the goal statement doesn't correspond with your test cases. In the goal statement, you start counting at 1 (the 2nd letter of \"two\" is \"w\"). In the tests, you start counting at 0 (the 4th letter of \"eight\" is \"t\"). I think you're starting at index 1 for other test cases too.\n\nThere's more stuff that needs to be done, but the first point is the most important work, because that will get people to understand what this challenge is.",
