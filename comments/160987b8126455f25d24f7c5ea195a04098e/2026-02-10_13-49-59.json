Dropping diagonals is probably the right solution.

If you find at least one of each then it's a tie.",

I think it would be much more Clash-like if diagonal lines didn't count, and then it would be OK for Fastest and Shortest.  Omitting diagonals would confuse things for Reverse, but that could be rescued with a good enough example (maybe a 5x5 Checkered but with one cell flipped)\n\nA thing I like about the simplified problem is that players can decide whether they actually want to build a 2D array of the board, or do everything in one pass.",
