    "content": "Very nice puzzle.\nJust 3 small suggestions:\n1. The sentence \"There are three positive integers, called triads\" sounds a bit ambiguous to me (Is there only one triad?), so maybe replace it with something like \"A set of three positive integers is called a triad\"\n2. Looking at other puzzles, it seems like the standard input and output format is space separated, not comma separated. I don't know if you want to change this at this stage, maybe a suggestion for future puzzles.\n3. Only IDE test 8 and none of the validators assume that triads can contain duplicate integers, meaning that a solution that assumes triads only contain unique integers can still pass all the validators, but not all the IDE tests. If this is intended, I suggest replacing IDE test 8; if this is not intended, a validator testing this behavior should be added. As others have already noted, stating this more explicitly in the statement would be nice.\nGood work! I would approve it if I could.",

    "content": "Goal\n* Please delete \"from a given list L\".\n\n* Do you think it's necessary to specify that the triads always consist of unique integers? For example, consider the case when the input is 1,2,3. The answer will be different when the uniqueness condition is imposed from that when it isn't.\n\nOr it may also be the other way round: the triads do not have to consist of unique integers. In that case, please also specify that in the statement and add a pair of cases similar to 1,2,3.\n\nInput\n* Please add \"[[L]]\" after \"a sorted subset\".\n\nStub generator\n* Please add a write statement.\n\nCover picture\n* Suggest to add a cover picture for this puzzle.
