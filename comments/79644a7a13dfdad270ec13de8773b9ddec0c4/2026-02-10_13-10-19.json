The value of each number card is the same as its rank, while the value of {{Jack}}, {{Queen}}, {{King}}, {{Ace}} are {{11}}, {{12}}, {{13}} and {[14}} respectively.\n\n(That's based on your solution code - it seems to be different from your statement.)\n\n* In the list of quality of the win, 0 should not be described as \"Good\" as it is not really the expected output and thus confusing. Please delete that line.\n\nOutput\n* Please separate the scenarios of non-war and war into two sections. The instruction to output nothing for Line 1 and \"war\" for Line 2 is incorrect, as \"war\" should be output in Line 1 in case of a war.\n\nThanks.",
