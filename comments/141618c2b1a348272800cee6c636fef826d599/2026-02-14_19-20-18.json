    "content": "Thank you for the suggestion! I see why \"Palindromic Numbers\" sounds appealing because it relates to symmetry. However, the concept here is a bit different: balanced numbers are defined by the sums of digits on either side of the middle, not necessarily by being palindromes. Some balanced numbers aren’t palindromic, and some palindromes aren’t balanced. So I think the current title better reflects the actual problem, but I appreciate your input!",
