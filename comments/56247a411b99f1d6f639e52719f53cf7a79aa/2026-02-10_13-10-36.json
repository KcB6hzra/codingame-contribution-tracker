Great idea!\n\nI have made all your suggested changes except the last one about starting an expression with a minus sign.

    "content": "Regarding having expressions that start with a negative sign, I like the idea and it was not terribly difficult to add to my solution. I will now have to add it to my test case generator and test it with more complex equations. I'm thinking about adding the following constraint:\n\n\"All terms of each equation are unique non-zero integers.\"\n\nHaving a negative sign in the front of an expression implies a leading zero. I'd prefer not to allow an explicit zero term anywhere in any equation. The only test case that is then not covered is the following:\n\nx+3=0\n\nZero is a very unique number that probably adds unwanted complexity to an already difficult puzzle.",

You could have a negative sign in one of your intermediate steps, but that is your choice.\n\nI believe I can write a detailed proof if necessary, but for now, let me just address your two examples:\n\nEasy: You're welcome to move the 168 from the right side to the left side, but that is just an intermediate step and it will have to moved back to the right side for the final answer which creates a leading positive number on the right side.\n\nMedium: Again, as an intermediate step, you are welcome to factor a -1 out of the expression (20+(x+103-34)-100). However, to get to a final answer you'll have to undo that step since you created an extra set of parentheses by doing it and the rules require a minimum number of parentheses.\n\nI feel very confident that an equation cannot be written that when solved for X will result in an expression or subexpression on the right side of the equal sign that must begin with a negative sign. Let me know if you can think of other possible examples.",
