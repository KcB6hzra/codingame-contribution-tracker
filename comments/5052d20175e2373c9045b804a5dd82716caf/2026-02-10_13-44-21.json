    "content": "Hi, Yukiko.\nThanks for your feedback.\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"maybe whitout many exception in different form?\"\nIf you mean removing the tricky cases, well... that would be a pity. I think that here, the whole point is that it looks simple (split on the pipes ? regex ? Use whitespaces and dots ...?) until you realize their can't be a solution considering only one line at a time.\n\nIf I keep only the two first cases, then it is trivial. In fact, it started as a CoC but I soon realized everything I thought about that problem was wrong. Afterward, the solution might seem obvious when looking at all the test cases (I can't tell) but I'm pretty sure many people will go for a line by line solution before realizing it is impossible. And that is for me the main (if not only) point of this puzzle. That seems a bit harsh to expect in 5 minutes, but for a simple puzzle, I think it has a nice twist.",
