    "content": "I like it very much, because the naive first ideas might be complicated whereas there is in fact a simple solution.\n\nHowever I think the description is difficult to understand. I think the sentence \"Each of these lines consists of the chars and the missing chars\" is confusing. In the description of the input, \"Each of these lines consists of the missing chars\" is wrong. What do you think of something like: \"Each of these lines is a representation of a row of the keyboard, where missing keys are represented with '*'\"? Then the example makes it very clear.\n\nMaybe you could also add that the keyboard may not be a US \"qwerty\" keyboard.\n\nIn addition, I think the examples allow to understand the puzzle, so I would suggest it for reverse mode too.",

    "content": "'Expect 3 lines. Each of these lines consists of the missing chars in the order they are presented on the keyboard.'\n\nThis doesn't make sense to me. Missing chars are not in the input. They are missing.\nI understood the problem immediately from the input/output example but I think the statement itself should be reworded to be more clear. Also dvorak test seems unnecessary to me. I personally wouldn't base my solution on keyboard layout but if someone would, this might be very confusing for them, especially since not everyone knows about the existence of such layout.",

    "content": "In current version there is actually no relation to the keyboard as such: all you need is to check which abcs are missing out of 26. I would approve this contribution if you fix the statement to mention it (and avoid any relation to keyboard).\nBut the description makes me think that the idea behind was different. Personally after reading the statement I  expected the output chars to be sorted  in the order they are missing. I would change the expected output to:\nexpect 3 lines. Each of these lines consists of the missing chars in the order they are presented on the keyboard.\n\nAll in all, I see some contradiction here. \nThis is only my personal opinion. Good luck!",
