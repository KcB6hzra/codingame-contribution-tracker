Avoid giving a goal when your proposal is for Reverse only, because the mode of the clash is after the goal so people testing your clash will already know what to do.\n\nhere an example of code with 100 test and 25% validators:\na,b = map(int,input().split())\nc,d = map(int,input().split())\nr= b+a == d-c\nprint('YES' if r else 'NO')",

    "content": "❌ Rejected the contribution.\nComment: Binary outputs should be avoided in Clash of Code because solutions like print(\"YES\") get easy 50%. It's especially bad in reverse mode because there are multiple patterns that will fit when there's only two options for each test case. An example of a pattern that would get all (visible) tests right is \"is the absolute value of the last number on the first row smaller than the absolute value of the last number on the last row\". Also needs way more test cases. Only half of the tests (1, 3, 5, and 7) are visible to players; the other half is used to validate the answer.",
