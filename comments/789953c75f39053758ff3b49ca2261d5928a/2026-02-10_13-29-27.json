    "content": "Nice clash, but I think it needs at least another pair of test cases.\n\nValidator 1 actually turned out to be the hardest one in the Reverse clash I just did. I got 100% on the test cases, but then 75% on validators because of Validator 1.\n\nThe problem was that I took the new_hour as 24 - old_hour, then I said new_hour = new_hour - 1 if old_minute > 0\n\nI should have said \"if old_minute > 0 or old_second > 0\", but none of your test cases had an example where this difference mattered, so I didn't notice the error.\n\nIt would be good if you could add a test case like below:\n05:00:10  => 18:59:50",

    "content": "So, for (CG) magical reason all answers to a rejection are removed along with it. Sorry about that. The mass rejection was not so much about a specific CoC but the way you spammed them to get some validated mechanically. Note that the CoC themselves were often too close to the \"basic reference\" to my taste, and thus very likely already common in the database. Subjects with variation like this one are better imo, because at least you're completing to 24h instead of the basic timestamp to date. Note that I usually don't intervene in CoC validation, I let you in the hands of those who enjoy them.\n\nNote: maybe you should clarify in the statement that hours are in range 0-24.",
