    "content": "\"Segments intersecting\" is confusing, because that terminology is generally used for 2D space. Say \"Determine if 2 ranges overlap.\"\n\nThe idea is fine for CoC, but I think you can be more adventurous and not limit the first number to always being less than the second number for each range (also, \"beginning\" and \"end\" are odd choices. Just say \"boundaries\"). Also consider edge cases, like a range of 0 size, or the two ranges touching but not overlapping. Depending on your choice, adjust your Constraints section accordingly.\n\nFinally, change the puzzle so that \"True/False\" is not the output (CodinGame convention of avoiding binary output puzzles). Maybe something like reporting the distance of non overlapping ranges, or the overlapping space if they are overlapping?",

    "content": "Thanks, I really don't know English well. I fixed all the above errors. A problem with this idea was recently given to me at an interview. The idea is that it is not optimal to solve this problem directly, but it is necessary to solve the inverse to it (check that they do not intersect and reverse the answer). That is why there are no additional complications. I left only 'schortest', since it is not relevant in 'fasters'.",
