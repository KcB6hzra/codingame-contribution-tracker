The 1x5x1 didn't help my understanding at all.\n- Instead of w1, w2, w3, h1, h2, h3, please use only width, length, and height. And then specify that the front view is width X height, right view is length X height, and top view is width X length. It's less confusing and also helps correctly orient the top view.\n- It's frustrating when a line has fewer characters than what you would expect because the line is supposed to end with spaces, e.g. \"  ##\" instead of \"  ##  \". Please use periods as padding or guarantee consistent line width for each view.\n- Also dividing each layer, I would just print a newline with no space, i.e. \"\\n\" instead of \" \\n\". Or better yet, separate them with three equal signs or something: \"===\\n\".\n- Finally, the statement is a bit hard to read, and it really needs some markup. If you don't know had to add that, click the question mark next to \"Goal Statement\" when you are editing.\n\nBesides that, it's not bad! :)",

    "content": "\"one by one layer separated by space\"\nSeems like they are separated by a blank line, not by a space character?\n\n\"# #(the highest layer)\"\nLooks like there's an extra space character there.\n\nThere are some formatting standards available. Markup your examples and variables appropriately.\n\nI also suspect that some people will think they are supposed to include the text \"(the lowest layer)\" and \"(the highest layer)\" in the output, since that's what it's your example.\n\nYou also have not specified what orientation the output layers should be in - I assume that the back face is the first line and the front face is the last line of each layer, but you haven't explicitly said so.",
