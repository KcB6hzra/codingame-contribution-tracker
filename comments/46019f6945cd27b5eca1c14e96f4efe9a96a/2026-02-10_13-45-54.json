    "content": "I think the math and/or physics of this dont really check out, especially since its not clearly specified, how the change of speed occurs.\n\nWithout having looked at this with any depth, I think the math only checks out if the speed change happens non-continously at full seconds, which is not how trains work, traditionally.\n\nIf this is how its supposed to be, then at least it should  be mentioned that physics is being violated, as, if one is being told that \"the train's speed decreases by half  every second\", one would not expect this to happen in large quanta.",

    "content": "The 2nd example with S=40 and L=100, shouldn't that be false? \n\nAlso, I think you should state that the 1st example (L=10, S=5) would be false. The way it is stated now, it is ambiguous whether that situation is considered true or false. I suggest rewording the sentence: \n\"The speed will just get smaller and smaller to be like 0.000000596 feet/second, so unless there is a trick...\" \nto something like:\n\"The speed will continue to get smaller and smaller but will never reach 0 feet/second. Therefor the output would be false (because the train would only ever be able to reach 9.9999999999... feet and not 10 feet).\" The stuff in parentheses aren't necessarily needed, but it will help explain why this example is false.",
