    "content": "The statement could be made a lot clearer. The challenge should not be in understanding what to do but in programming a solution.\n\nHere's a few adjustments I would do:\n- It is too concise. Don't be afraid to be more verbose with the statement, make sure every element is perfectly clear. For example, instead of explaining both groups at the same time, you could split each definition in its own paragraph (e.g. An additive group is a group that contains a zero and any two members of the set added together give a result that is also in the set.);\n\n- There's not enough examples. You should give an example of a GROUP* showing where to do the mod N and how to multiply every element (you could use a set of 3 elements here so the statement doesn't become unnecessarily long).",

I think in fact you're asking to check if they are monoids (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup) and semirings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring), but this would be probably confusing. Maybe you can just make abundantly clear, with a disclaimer, that for the sake of this problem that's the definition of group and ring, and leave an address for algebraists to file their complaints ;)",

Maybe I'll change the title to Monoids and Semirings, that sounds cooler.\n\nI'm afraid the next observation will be that you can meet the identity requirement in other ways without the 0/1, and then on and on until we have a full textbook.  I'm torn between adding clarifications vs. keeping it as a simple introduction to a topic many might not have been exposed to before.",
