Of course it's not the hardest one in the easy category :-) but this puzzle is probably too long for a clash. If i watch your own solution in C# it's obvious that it's very hard to write 90 lines of code in less than 15 minutes !",

So, I don't think the similarity is that much.\"\n\nAnd I'm agreeing with that :)\n\nMuch of the work of my puzzle is figuring out how to change a hex-value to a 8-by-8 bit array (am I saying that right?), which is not at all needed in the puzzle you reference.",
