    "content": "Agree with kayou, this clash shouldn't be in Reverse mode.\n\nI just got it in a clash and managed to get 100% on test cases, but then got 33% on the actual validators because NONE of the test cases test the difference between rounding the answer and truncating it. Whereas FOUR validators do...\n\nReverse mode clashes need to have very well-defined test cases if you want people to reverse engineer the problem... ended up losing to a bot who got 100%, but all the humans and one other bot got 33% or 0% in the end.\n\nI suggest swapping 'multiple grade' with 'Validator 3' and 'Final test' with 'Validator 6'. Also I just don't think this is simple enough for reverse mode, as kayou says.\nIt took me 12 minutes to solve. The main problem is that subjects can have multiple separate marks and it's not evident that the weight shouldn't be applied to each assessment, but rather you need to first average the marks for the subject and THEN apply the weight and THEN take the average of all subjects. It's a lot to ask for reverse mode.",
