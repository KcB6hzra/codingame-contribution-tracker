You force good players that figured out both solutions to wonder which solution is an intended one and if validators would work for both solutions or not.\nNot that big of a deal but it's better to not force players to take a leap of faith.\n\nUPD: Also, you can just take coordinates of the first and the last '#' that you encounter and take an average.\nJust add some non-symmetric shapes and it'll fix everything.",
