I'm not certain what you mean by \"hard to understand what you are waiting for, after reading your solution\", so I'd love some clarification. Lastly, this puzzle is far too simple to be classed as an easy puzzle.",

Given the examples I think it's plain to see that the output is a 12-hr clock format since it ranges from H:00 to H:59. I think you're talking just about reverse mode here since the other two modes you suggested are already part of this challenge; how much easier should it be? I really do not think this is difficult to figure out, especially given some of the reverse challenges I have encountered.",
