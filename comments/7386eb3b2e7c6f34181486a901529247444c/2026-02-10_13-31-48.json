It might be overkill, but considering each cell you have a system of linear equations that can be solved with numpy.linalg.solve(). Maybe if the test cases were bigger that wouldn't be a feasible solution?",

I ended up with this fortress game, named indeed after Akira Kurosawa's movie.\n(Note that the rules are pretty simple and natural so it's very likely that this puzzle has already been adressed by someone else.)\nSo I created a playable version of it that keeps track of your best time for a given size, and it was surprisingly fun to play, at some point you must develop new techniques to save time :-)",

    "content": "My goal was to have test cases as big as possible because in theory even with n = 5000 you could still solve it - the fast solution is only O(n^2) - but unfortunately the I/O format doesn't allow more than ~1000 chars in total for the input so a 5000 x 5000 grid is out of question.\n\nAt least n = 31 prevents from using the usual techniques that are used for griddlers (often based on a mix of elimination and backtracking), so it's not that bad.\n\nIt indeed allows for O(n^3) solutions, like those based on linear algebra, but well, why not. It's still an interesting way to solve the problem. And maybe if a user solves it with numpy, then takes a look at other solutions and sees that there are short solutions without numpy, it will motivate him to give it another try without numpy ?",
