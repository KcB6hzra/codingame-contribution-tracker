    "content": "I like this, that's a nice clash idea.\n\nSomething I would nitpick before validation however, is that you've put the goal in the Input field.\nThe Input should probably be something like \"<<Line 1:>> A 12-hour formatted string\", and same with the output.\n\nAlso, the test cases are good, but the validators don't match their associated tests; this is easy to fix in your case, you can just make the validator have the same hour, but only change the minutes (validators are there to prevent hardcoding, not to cover other cases).\n\nOther than that, that's a nice puzzle; it has my upvote.",
