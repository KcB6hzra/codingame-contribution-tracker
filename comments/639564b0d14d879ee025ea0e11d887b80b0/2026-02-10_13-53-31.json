I can't think of a specific bug that would cause this, but that hasn't stopped it from happening in the past. :-)\n\nThis puzzle has a couple of pretty simple solutions. I'd recommend one of the following:\n\n - Make each validator a mirror image of the corresponding test\n - Make each validator the same as the corresponding test with all inputs and switches toggled\n\nIn either case, you can make the current validators into new tests if you're particularly fond of them. :-)",

The first example would greatly benefit from featuring one, to provide a visual impression (half of the puzzle *is* graphical recognition)\n(- by the way, from an electronics point of view, it feels a bit weird to feature switches at the same level as gates.)\n- the constraints kind of make it obvious brute force enumeration is expected. But there's already a serious puzzle just with the chart recognition, it wouldn't be easy to split.\n- the shared characters are quite unfortunate. They make human recognition harder, and restrict the possibilities for solving the recognition part of the problem. Could you consider e.g. A, O, X for AND OR XOR, a, o, x for NAND NOR XNOR?\n- the constraints could use a liitle nudge in the lines of \"planar circuit; no loops\"",

Again same layout but gates are different. So there should be no diffrence in coding / difficulty\n\n- test / validator #3 :  introduction of wires' forking. Here indead the layouts are completly differents, but still no new features.\n\n- test / validator #4 : introduction of switches. No wire forking here. But in validator the switch is inversed. Alsothe layout is different, but then people shouldn't have any problem at this stage.\n\n- test / validator #5 : introduction of inverted gates (XNOR, NOR and NAND). Otherwise no new concepts\n\n- test / validator #6 : no new features, just a big layout with all features.\n\nBut I agree I should add more tests/validators to introduce the gates a couple at a time. Maybe like this;\n\n#1 : AND\n#2: OR\n#3 : mix of AND and OR\n#4 : NOT\n#5 : NAND and NOR\n#6 : XOR and XNOR\n#8 : switches\n#7: wire forking\n#9 : complex layout (wire forking, switches, many gates)\n\nWhat do you reckon ?",

    "content": "I will never argue with more tests. :-) That being said, I think that what you have is probably good enough. I'm just recommending that you make the validators more like the associated tests. It's not a strong recommendation. Just something that I see as an opportunity. If you'd prefer not to, that's just fine.\n\nAs an example, \"Fork ?\" and \"Fork !\" are very different from each other. The validator could be written instead as a mirror of the test like so:\n\n`\n         [@]         \n          |          \n         [~]         \n          |          \n        [ | ]        \n         | |         \n      +--+ +--+      \n      |       |      \n    [ | ]   [ | ]    \n     | |     | |     \n  +--+ +--+--+ +--+  \n  |       |       |  \n[ & ]   [ & ]   [ | ]\n | |     | |     | | \n | +--+--+ +--+--+ | \n |    |       |    | \n[~] [ | ]   [ & ] [~]\n |   | |     | |   | \n 0   0 1     1 1   0 \n`\n\nRemember, the validators are simply there to ensure that the user has successfully solved the concepts introduced in the tests. The CG populace, in general, spends a lot of time debugging failed validators. The simpler the validators (while still doing verification) the better.\n\n Just my 2¢.\n\n - danBhentschel\n\nEDIT: Ack! Formatting! Hopefully you get the idea. :-)",

We would have a special case for NOT which would be a single ~, hence people would have to look at next char for differenciation.\n\nfor the switches I introduce them in a specific test so that people can start focusing on parsing and simple logic first.\n\nBut indeed brute force is the easiest way of solving this. I'm sure other method are possible and would allow for much more complex circuits (many inputs and switches). But even with brute force you can optimize a bit to stop path that would lead to a longer solution that the current best one, since order of toggling has no impact on solution.\n\nMaybe for an harder version of this with more than 2 inputs for gates, and more than 2 outputs for switches.",
