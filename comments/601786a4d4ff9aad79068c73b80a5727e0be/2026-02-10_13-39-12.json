    "content": "Good one but too wordy.\nWhat I propose:\nCut the \"Information\" section from the statement. It's already present in the Constraints.\nMake the statement shorter. You can cut most of the lore.\nIn the first paragraph, only the description of the reward is worth leaving.\nThe second paragraph can be cut entirely.\nThe third one is fine but cut out the second 'now' from it.\n\n\nAlso, your code breaks on F=48 and forward. The trivial solution would still work tho.\nAlways add corner cases to the test. It'll catch solutions like that and will check your solution.",

    "content": "I like the puzzle, but have a few suggestions to improve the description:\n\nThe squares on the chess board suddenly become \"fields\". I would stick to \"squares\".\n\n\"rice grains\" change to \"rice corns\" then back again (\"grains\" makes more sense).\n\n\"amount of [rice corns]\" and \"amount of [fields]\" should be \"number of...\" (use \"number\" for things that can be counted, \"amount\" for things that cannot)\n\nThere are 2^63 grains of rice on the last square of the chess board.\nThis single square has enough rice for any input, so the output should always be 1.\nI think you need to add \"*starting with the first square*, how many squares...\"",
