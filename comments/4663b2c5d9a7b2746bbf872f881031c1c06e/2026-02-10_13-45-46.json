    "content": "I see what the problem is.\nThe validators are NOTHING like the tests. The rule is that they should be different, but comparable. The values you used in the validators are with 5-6 digits. I started with a minimum of 99999, which was then reduced every time I encountered a lower value, to find the smallest available slice after each of Maks's choices. When I saw I had 100%, and it was a \"SHORTEST\" mode Clash, I tried 9999, and then 999, as the original value, and it worked fine each time.\nThis worked for all of the tests and only one of the validators.\nRegardless, it is plain to see that the tests are miles off from the validators. They are a completely different set of problems.",

But for Maks to take the biggest area of pizza he has to take the values 100 , 1 , 100 ; ' 1 ' is common for both Lina and Maks .
