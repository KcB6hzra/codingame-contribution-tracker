The problem statement is clear and concise.\n\nI'd still like to see you switch this back to Medium just to try to engage a larger audience. This is a wonderful puzzle with several learning opportunities. All kinds of arguments can be made about it being Medium or being Hard. When a puzzle falls in the middle ground like this, I argue for the lower category just for the sake of engaging a larger audience.",

    "content": "I should have seen this earlier. The \"hard\" label intrigues me. After reading the goal, I thought there was no chance I would support the \"hard\" classification. I am complete with the first 18 test cases / validators and now I am timing out. I respectfully ask for more time before I pass judgement, but as of now, I'm liking this puzzle a lot and I'm no longer convinced that the \"hard\" moniker will not be appropriate.",

    "content": "This is a great puzzle and I can tell from the test cases, a lot of work has gone into getting it just right. The optimization needed to finish is a nice touch. For me, the hardest part was keeping the details straight. I had xs and ys flying all over the place and it was crazy easy to get confused. I want to rewrite my code using a namedtuple for a Point and see if I can make it easier to follow.\n\nI think there are plenty of Codingamers that might not see this puzzle due to the \"hard\" classification. It was plenty tough for me, but not so tough that I had to bang my head against the wall for several days. I'd hate for the true Medium level puzzler to miss out on this great puzzle. A Hard classification is fine, but I would support Medium in hopes of making sure as many Codingamers as possible take a swing.",
