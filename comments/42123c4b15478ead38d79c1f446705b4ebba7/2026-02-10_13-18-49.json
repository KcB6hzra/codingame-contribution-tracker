    "content": "This is so frustrating in Reverse, haha.\nI never thought to use the same [[n]] that defines the number of input lines in the actual solution! :(((\n\nVery tricky! But it's so solvable if you can think of it! Having so many values makes it so hard to figure out, because you end up on so many wild goose chases. Nice clash though. :)\n\nIt would be nicer on Reverse players if you had less random integers in at least one more test case. Something like [[n]] = 5 and the inputs on one line are \"5 10 15 20 25\" -> 75\nThat would have helped a lot!\n\nI still came 2nd with a very hacky solution below. Got 40%. Only one person got 100%.\nn = gets.to_i\nn.times do\n  inputs = gets.split\n  a = []\n  for j in 0..(n-1)\n    a << inputs[j].to_i\n  end\n  if a.size > 1\n    x = a[0]\n    if x == a.max\n        a = [x]\n    else\n        a = a[1..]\n    end\n  end\n  p a.sum\nend",

    "content": "No problem :)\n\nPlease consider changing the stub generator as per my earlier comment.\n\nAs for your question:\n\nA clash player can see the tests during a clash, but they cannot see the validataors. However, after they submit their code, their score is based on the validators, not the tests.\n\nThat reminds me, you have to change your cases so that tests and validators are similar but different. They should be different, to prevent hardcoding. However they should be similar, to ensure that the requirement is tested.\n\nThis is particularly important in Reverse mode, because the players cannot see the statement or the title, and they have to rely on the visible test cases to deduce the requirement. It will be a nasty shock to the player if the validator tests something which cannot be deduced, or is difficult to deduce, based on the tests.",
