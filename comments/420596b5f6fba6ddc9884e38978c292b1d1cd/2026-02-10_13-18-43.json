This is a cute \"real life\" scenario.\nThe phrasing needs a bit of tidying up.  \n\nSuggestions:\n(1)\nFirst, it's \"You are a master logger\".\nThen it's \"this logger\" and \"he asks himself\"\nYou go from \"2nd person\" (\"you\") to 3rd person.\nBe consistent re if you are talking to someone or about someone.\n\n(2)\nIs this person a logger or a woodcutter?  These are generally two different occupations and it's needlessly confusing.\n\n(3) \nAntlers??  What ... I thought I (or someone) was providing wood",

Or the statement should be clarified.\n\nIf the population grows at the rate of 20% per year, then it means that it grows by 20% every year. So the number of Otters after M years with N Otters in the beginning would be N * (1.2 ** M).\n\nAnd there is a problem with statement here as well: should we round up or down? To the nearest integer? Or we must round after every year?\n\nLike this:\nresult = int(N * (1.2 ** M))\nor this:\nresult = N\nfor _ in range(M): result = int(result * 1.2)",

To do this...).\n\n* You should start a new sentence at \"but the population\" (i.e. ... 4 wood. But the population...).\n\n* If 20% is a constant which applies to ALL cases, the relevant sentence should be moved above the example, with the percentage formatted as a {{constant}}. Including it as part of the example seems to suggest that the percentage applies to that example only.\n\n* Including \"10 years\" in the first paragraph seems to suggest that is also part of the requirement, while it is not. Suggest to change that sentence to remove any potential confusion.\n\nCases\n* Each pair of test and validator should be similar (e.g. in terms of magnitude) but remain different. Please change the cases so that there are no duplicates. (e.g. Test 1 should be different from Validator 1.)\n\nThanks.",
