    "content": "To me reverse implies either taking a step backwards, or possibly assuming the other role (as the machine instead of the player). I wouldn't say the title is incorrect, it's just not the game I expected. But it's the perfect difficulty level for an easy puzzle. Would a clearer title indicate something about resetting, completing, or revealing the board? I'm not sure. Looked at a different way, it's setting an initial configuration after the mines have been planted. But titles don't have to be precise anyway. The more interesting things are what you can do with minesweeper. Solve it, obviously, as a solo game that already exists. For classic in/out, plant a certain number of mines to satisfy a partially completed board... but it's probably too difficult to ensure that there's only one solution. Determine all the spots where a mine must, could, and can't exist. Find a missing number given the rest of the board, e.g. if a spot is opened that does not contain a mine. Just some thoughts. I do like this one, as it's very straightforward.",

Then you have to plant the mines in a way that's consistent with that, and corner the bot player into a position where it can't be completely sure that the next move is safe. So you can totally cheat, in a way, but it has to be consistent with what's shown on the board.",
