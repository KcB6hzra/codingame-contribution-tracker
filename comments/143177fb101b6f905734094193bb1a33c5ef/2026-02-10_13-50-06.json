    "content": "The puzzle is good, but the description is impenetrable.  The worked example takes a while to unpack because it tends to melt into a wall of numbers and pluses.  Maybe the characters of [[message]] don't need to be converted numerically there; people can get informally that s+2 is u.  Also, careful use of monospace and alignment can help to get across the idea in broad strokes.  All the necessary information is there in an example, but it looks like soup.\n\nFinally, I would find it helpful if the example in the description used a message with spaces in it, say \"i am one\" instead of \"someone\".  It doesn't cost anything, and when the example continues to disregard whitespace, it'd be a very economical way to convey the correct handling.\n\nSome of the sentences can just be deleted.  This draft has \"Each character is encrypted independently of other characters.\"  I find this unnecessary and misleading.  Surely if you were to delete one character of the plaintext, the correspondence between the rest of the message and the key would be affected!\n\nIt's a good Clash; just let it shine more.",
