Some remarks follow.\n\nFirst, the tests could be renamed \"Figure 1\", \"Figure 2\", ... instead of \"xxx-1\", \"xxx-2\", ...\n\nThen, the validating tests 1and 2 seem more complex than the corresponding training one. Some syllogisms in the validating tests don't correspond to any of the 4 figures, while there are no such case in the training tests.\n\nFinally, in \"Validate xxx-1\", there is a test for figure 4 (3rd: all p are m and all m are s therefore all s are p), which is misleading.",

Also one only needs to store the 2 premises and the current conclusion. So It can be read sequencially and stored in 3 variables. No need to preallocate more than that\n\nAnother solution could be to have 1 simple syllogism (2 premises 1 conclusion) per test, and have many tests and validators to cover more mood/figures combinations.\n\nWhat do you suggest would be best ?",
