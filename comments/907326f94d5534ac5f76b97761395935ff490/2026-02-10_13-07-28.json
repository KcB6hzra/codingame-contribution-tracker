    "content": "This clash isn't fair for Reverse mode currently.\n\nAll test cases can be solved with simply \"string.size % 9\" as the answer, there is no test case that forces clashers to repeatedly do it until a single digit is reached. Without such a test case, it's not fair to expect clashers to reverse engineer the solution from incomplete information.\n\nIt sucks to get 100% on tests then only 75% on Validators, and it's completely unfair when it happens on Reverse. You should add a test case that has a solution that is not the same as simply \"string.size % 9\".\n\nCurrently it's just Validator 1 that causes an issue, since you expect \"9\" as the answer, and not \"0\".",

I truly appreciate the effort you've put into reviewing it.\n\nI've carefully considered your concerns and have made adjustments accordingly. Specifically, I've restructured the test cases to ensure a more balanced distribution in terms of length, as well as aligned the validators with their respective tests.\n\nI understand the importance of ensuring that the solution remains challenging yet fair for players, especially during the reverse phase. I believe these changes address the issues you've raised and provide a clearer pattern for players to follow.\n\nI hope that with these modifications, the clash will now meet the standards expected. However, if there are still any lingering doubts or further improvements needed, I will simply move into another problem.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your valuable feedback and considerations. I'm committed to delivering the best possible contributions to the platform.",

Maybe just the length would be enough to make it a decent reverse clash, I'm not sure about that one though 🤷",
