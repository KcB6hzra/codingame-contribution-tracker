When Tyler snaps his fingers, he stops talking and the narrator starts.\n>\n> You are given a conversation between the narrator and Tyler, in which the narrator begins, and a snap is represented as {{*Snap*}}. You must find out who talks last.\n\nPlus, I don't understand: why would no one be talking if no snap occurs, when you say that the narrator is the one that starts talking? Shouldn't the narrator be the answer if no snaps occur?",
