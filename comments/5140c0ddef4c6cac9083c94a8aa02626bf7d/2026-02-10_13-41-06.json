    "content": "I am sorry, but I don't like it because there are many issues.\n\n1) First problem is the zero page test. Your validation looks wrong to my eyes. Maybe I don't understand well enough so excuse me. The naive approach is to log an history of papers to do. So you generate the initial list of papers, and then process it.\n\nI pass the zero page with this:\n6 3 3\n[6, 5, 0, 7, 2, 1]\n[5, 4, 0, 6, 1, 0]\n[4, 3, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n5 4 3 2 1 0\n\nbut I fail the simple test with this:\n5 7 3\n[2, 1, 4, 3, 6]\n[1, 0, 3, 2, 5]\n[0, 0, 2, 1, 4]\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 3]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n5 4 3 2 1 0\n\nNotice the count of non-zero papers in the first row. I can swap around when I process the papers to count before/after, but then other test fails. There is an ambiguity in the statement regarding what to do when a paper is already \"done\" at first step.\n\n2) Second problem is the performance issue. Looking at your solution, it's not obvious what a \"stick\" is and nothing in the statement indicates that you have to compute things this way. Therefore, I expect few people to be able to find such an \"optimization\".\n\n3) And finally the Linear congruential generator is just a random number generator. Don't make the statement look so impressive with this massive formula and explain that it is just a random number we need for the computation, and that is the formula being used here.\n\nOverall, I like the idea, but there are presentation issues and ambiguities. I hope you can improve it.",

Therefore, the easy puzzles must be easy to understand and easy to solve : you must struggle to write easy-ish instructions that solve the problem given, maybe sometimes optimise it a bit (for example : refactor 2 loops in one) so you can solve a larger case, and not be about using hardcore maths (looking at you puzzles from user nicola :p), or any flood fill (looking at you 'mountain of moles' puzzle).\n\nThis puzzle will definitely frighten any beginner reading it...\n\nTag it medium, then you'll have my approval ;).",

You waste time understanding what the puzzle is about, what the formula is about and you don't initially think all the puzzle is about is to find a trick to calculate everything efficient.\n\nI would rather see some part rewritten to make it less confusing. Look at the previous history, it's been rejected because of those reasons before. But maybe I'm wrong.\n\nEDIT: look at PiterYeh comment below.",
