They don't do any sorting, it's a mix of when the variable appears in the expression, but also at which point in the expression it becomes clear which category the variable belongs to... it's not really fair to expect such a complex sort for this. I won my clash with 80%, 2nd place got 80% too, the rest got 0%.\n\nIt should just be alphabetical, but the issue is that would require edits to output forTest 3 and Validator 3, and Validator 5 would also need editing. The rest of them would be the same though...\n\nI'm tempted to edit it, but it's a pretty big choice, hopefully JCProgrammer will respond.",

I got 100% on tests and it seemed like the natural way to sort them based on your note that 'variable output order matters', but then got 80% on validators.\n\nThe other commenters and I were only suggesting alphabetical as an alternative because it seemed like it would avoid confusion, but if you can just edit your note to describe this way of sorting that you've used, then that works. :) But you should also add a test case that differentiates between these, like Validator 5 does, or else clashers won't have a means to debug the sort order in-clash.",
