    "content": "Just got this in a clash and couldn't solve it in time.\nPartly because it was shortest mode and I was golfing while solving, but I genuinely found reading the statement most of the challenge.\n\nThe musical chairs part is it's own simple clash that would take some getting used to, even when given n and the number of beats. But then having to calculate the beats and understand the values of all the symbols took longer than it should have for me. Long descriptions on tough challenges are a bit of a bind, because player's end up using up to half of their precious solving time on reading and understanding the statement. Fun concept though. :)",

    "content": "Hi Arglanir, \nSchema was wrong according to text: numbering of players was clockwise, so 1 was confusing ! I agree with you.\nYour suggestion is much more intuitive ! and I like the schema in a counterclockwise way, more logical and explicit with a 1 after the \"x=no chair\"\nSo I coded it as a solution and I changed all tests.  \nI added especially 2 tests that convinced me:\n4 players / 4 beats (a full circle, so same player = 4 is logical)  and 10 players/11 beats (so player '9 = 10 - 1' is a logical solution).\nThank a lot !",
