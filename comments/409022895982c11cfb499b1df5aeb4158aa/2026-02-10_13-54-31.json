They're the ones who make the problem statement wrong in multiple places.\nProblem 1: their first mention is \"you can't move them\". They ought to be mentioned for existence before.\nProblem 2: The second sentence of the first paragraph. (but don't change it yet, see discussion below)\nProblem 3: \"Rossi's position is always over the last dice he moved\"\n\nMy suggestion: write (well, leave) the statement as if IRON dice didn't exist. Split all exceptions they introduce into a separate section \"IRON dice\" that only applies for the latest test cases (I think that's already the case). That would be, if I'm not mistaken: existence; can't move, are always 6; group and walk over same as the other; jumping into the void is not allowed.\nRationale: much easier to explain in the beginning without strictly true convoluted sentences.\n\nMinor stuff:\n\n* I'd rather let some english native confirm (player_one, hello?), but AFAIK *die* is singular, *dice* is plural, *dices* is not an english word^Wnoun.\n\n* Moving dice around section: you ought to repeat the basic movement there near the beginning (the current first item is a consequence of that)",

A more precice description of the mechanics could be in order.\n\nExample ambiguities:\n\n* \"simply walk over it\" from context I expect that to mean \"change die he's on\" instead of \"step over and end up on the other side\", but it's hardly \"simply\".\n\n* having both UP/DOWN and TOP/BOTTOM. May I suggest going for E/W/N/S instead?\n\n* \"shortest solution\" but what *is* a solution? Intro says \"connect up and show 6\", but doesn't really define connectedness.\n\nSeems interesting. How would multiplayer have worked with that?",
