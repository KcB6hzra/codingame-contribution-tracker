    "content": "Thank you for your feedback. Here are the changes I made:\n\n - Moved some of the XOR properties at the end of the statement, in a \"for your curiosity\" category, since this information is not necessary to complete the clash.\n\n - Renamed the variable in the stub generator that were previously called mess, key and encrypted. They gave too much information for reverse mode so they are now called m, k and e.\n\n - Changed Test 1 and Test 2 to single bit key so that you get a better idea of what is happening. This made reverse mode easier but still challenging.\n\n - Modified all the validators to have the same message length and key length than the tests. This should prevent a 100% score on tests but a different score on validators (which is frankly the most frustrating thing ever in CoC).\n\nI can't wait to tackle the golf version of this ^^",

    "content": "The problem statement is very clear and explains the topic well. It's also definitely suitable for reverse mode :)\n\nI would suggest a couple changes to the tests:\n - Validator 2 is the only case where the key consists completely of 0. Perhaps make this its own test case?\n - Test 2 could have its key swapped so that it doesn't match Test 1 (10 instead of 01)\n - Maybe you could add test cases with single-bit messages or single-bit keys.\n - Validator 5 should match Test 5 (ie the message and key should be the same length)",
