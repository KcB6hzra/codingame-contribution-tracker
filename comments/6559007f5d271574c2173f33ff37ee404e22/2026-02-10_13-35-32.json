    "content": "A few things in the problem statement might need fixing.  First, the usual phrase (in en:us usage anyway) is \"greater than or equal to\" rather than \"superior or equal to\".  \n\nAlso, you have a variable \"nb_day\" in the constraints that isn't used anywhere in the problem statement.\n\nYou allow for p==0 in the constraints, but there is no test for that edge case.  I'd choose n=0 people needed to have probability p>=0.\n\nYou also allow for p==1 in the constraints.  That case has no solution, mathematically, but there's no output condition for \"no solution\".",

    "content": "It's good so long as your probabilities in the test and validator cases remain far enough away from exact values for f(n) to avoid the \"floating point equality\" problem.  (Not a problem with short decimal fractions, but watch out if you decide to add a \"boundary value\" edge case later...)\n\nFWIW: Python 3.9 added math.perm(n,k) to compute the number of permutations of n elements taken k at a time.  That's n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-k+1) so you get a very high precision answer with 1 - math.perm(365,n)/365**n as the probability of at least one duplicate",

I tried to have very explicit results and keep test and validators far from boundary values.\n\nSo I would be surprised if the digit precision is a problem in this CoC.\n\nI tried using math.perm(), it's a very good idea, I didn't know this function !

    "content": "Hello Husoski,\n\nThank you for your advices !\n\nI changed \"superior or equal to\" with \"superior or equal to\".\n\nI choose to add an input nbdays which is always 365. But maybe it was just better to just remove it from constraints. Do you have an advice ?\n\nFor p==0 case, i agree the best choice is n=0, but it could also be n=-inf or n=1 if we want a minimum number of people. So maybe it's better to change constraints with \"0 < p < 1\" instead of \"0 ≤ p ≤ 1\".\n\nAnd for p==1, I'm afraid of the floating position, because when I compile with p==1, I find result n=153. As you suggest it before, it's important to remain far enough from exact values to avoid the floating point equality. So again, maybe it's better to change constraints with \"0 < p < 1\" instead of \"0 ≤ p ≤ 1\".\n\nDo you tink it's god with constraints \"0 < p < 1\" ?\n\nThank you for your comment",
