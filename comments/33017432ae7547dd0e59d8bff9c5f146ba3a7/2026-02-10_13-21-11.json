Then the constraints could say there is only one best match.\n\nAlso, I think it would help to clarify what an \"error\" could be. I assumed a delta could be swapping a character, or insertion, or deletion, but passing the test cases don't require that.",

No other removal or insertion of characters is allowed.",
