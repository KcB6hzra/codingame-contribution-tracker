The only thing not obvious at first is what happens when you are on the same line, but reading carefully is enough (same line is not \"nearer\"). Same thing with the \"half\" : you handled that with the \"transgress\" verb.\n\nNow to the quibbles :)\n- Maybe the case where a player is not offside only because he is in his own half could have had a test where that would be obvious, instead of mingled with other players. Not 100% sure though, it depends how \"easy\" you intend this \"easy\" puzzle to be :)\n- I would have preferred a closer match test/validator, but since it seems that the coverage (especially of tests) is OK, this is minor indeed.\n- The template should mention the two lines that (always !) need to be printed.",

The puzzle concerns a relevant real-world problem which motivates the solver. The statement is very precise, unambiguous and coherent. If you're not familiar with the terminology, this will be a bit of a reading exercise, but this disadvantage on its own is not going to deter me from approving this contribution. There are many test cases and they are quite varied. The test names are at the same time very derived but also very original, which is, frankly, an impressive feat. :) \n\nWell done!",

    "content": "Edit: I believe the situation is more complex than how I wrote it below. I'm investigating test cases now.\n\nI have some code that only considers the second to last opponent as the offside line, not the ball. It only fails for #6: Fernando Redondo, The DM. I believe (things like) this might be a common problem for people that don't follow football. It took me a bit of time to figure out what was causing it, and I had to look at your reference code. I confirmed that was the problem by patching in the ball detection and decision making and seeing all the test cases pass.\n\nThe least you should do (imo), is make sure this single failing test case is not a validator, because that would mean it's impossible for puzzlers to figure out what the problem with their code is.\nWhat I recommend you do, is to add some more test cases for this problem, so people can figure out what they're doing wrong a bit easier.\n\nOther than that, I can't find a flaw in this puzzle. Maybe you could consider it a flaw that it's hard for a non-football fan to figure out exactly what to do, but you could just as easily consider this puzzle a challenging reading exercise. Very well done! :)",

I hope it is less confusing now? Here is the main paragraph I added:\n- If the ball is represented by lowercase o, then the attacking team is TEAM_A and the opponent team is TEAM_B. if the ball is uppercase O, then it is the other way arround.\n- The size of the pitch (screenshot) is width=51 x height=15. The half-way line is therefore at X=51//2=25.\n- TEAM_A attacks from right to left. The TEAM_A's half of the pitch is therefore 25 <= X <= 50 and its second-to-last is the player with the 2nd highest X coordinate.\n- TEAM_B attacks from left to right. The TEAM_B's half of the pitch is therefore 0 <= X <= 25 and its second-to-last is the player with the 2nd lowest X coordinate.\n- If the ball is at the touch line, i.e. the first or the last row (Y = 0 or Y=14), then it is a throw-in.\nThank you!",

The number of occurences of 'a' + 'A' + 'o' is always equal to 11, and same for 'b' + 'B' + 'O' (Remember that the ball position means there is a player who played from there too).\n\nFor the test cases, good point ! I can't tell if these 12 cases are exhaustive (I believe not !) but I tried to cover most of the realistic cases that I can think of, and that one can encounter in an actual football game.\nOf course, I ignored some advanced offside rules in the statement to avoid confusion, e.g. I assumed that a player always deliberatelly receive the ball from a teammate and never from an opponenent (Either ('o' + 'A') OR ('O' + 'B'), but in real world the ball can come from an opponent player and then no offside is called).\n\nAnyway, there is a lot of scenarios, variants, rules and field configurations to think about for sure :-)",

    "content": "Now the 6th test (Sergio Busquets) and both of the 12th tests fail without the ball consideration patch. The rest passes. I'm not sure about the 11th tests. Shouldn't they still pass because you only consider players up to the middle line? Now I look at it again, the wording \"The offside rule applies only to players in the opponent's half of the pitch\" doesn't really clear that up for me.\n\nPS, I almost lost my code. codingame creates a new url for the ide if you update the test cases (or possibly other parts of the contribution), so when I went to the new url, my code was gone. luckily I could still reopen an old tab to the old url with my code. I have saved it locally now :)",

I was also using a set to hold all the players, The failures today were both a result of two critical players sharing x positions on the field.
