    "content": "The constraint that states \"Divisions(/) are rounded down to the nearest whole number\" doesn't match the test cases. \n\nFor test 4, \"2/8-3\" equals -3 if you round the division 2/8 down to 0, but the test expects only \"2-8+3\" as a valid solution. \n\nIf we must round down the result after the entire expression is evaluated, there is still an issue. 2/8-3 = -2.75, which is -3 when rounding down (math.floor(-2.75)==-3 is true). int(-2.75) is not the same as rounding down, it simply truncates the float.\n\nThis test should be fixed or the constraint needs clarification.",
