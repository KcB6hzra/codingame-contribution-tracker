    "content": "I've still got a few issues with this.\n* the input format. And this is highly ironic, as my go-to gereral-purpose language can read those parenthesized int pairs in four characters or code. But this format does go against the general spirit here. As a hint, it shows in your stub generator: all you can provide in the default I/O code is \"ROW\", whereas your I/O section mentions CS And DS, nowhere to be seen in the stub.\n* how to get from those CS/DS to the visual representation is probably obvious to those who still do HTML tables, but would really need a more strict definition of the layout flow: where a cs/ds pair in the input actually goes in the table. Especially with the variable spans.\n* you call your operation \"split\", but it seems like it does more than that. Namely, it changes the table size. It could be called a split if it didn't have any influence elsewhere in the table, which would require it only being performed on cells with an even span in the requested direction. But as is seen in your example, it changes other cells' spans, so clarification is required.\n\nNits:\n* \"the table is rendered in HTML as\"... no, it's the opposite, given HTML renders as a table.\n* \"The cell to be split never has a span in the direction asked\" well, in the input specification each cell is given as a colspan/rowspan pair, neither of which is declared to be optional, so, yes, the cell to be split necessarily has a span in the split direction too. I get what you mean, but the current wording is flawed.",

    "content": "Stub: I appreciate the effort :-) But with no parentheses and still the comma, it's the worst of both worlds. Think of it this way: most C-derived languages (this might actually include Java in the CG style of thought) have proper parsing[*] for whitespace-delimited atoms. So if you can bring it to that perfect. It's possible in this puzzle by stripping all punctuation, that reduces it to a temperatures-style; it could be made even more parsable by turning each line in a sequence of [[NC]] number of new TDs, then NC lines of just [[CS]] [[RS]]. Unfortunately AFAIK the stub generator doesn't support nested loops, but you'd have a case to request CG staff help.\nIf you can't, or too seriously dislike the result for that, IMHO it was better with the parentheses. It's merely unfortunate that it makes your puzzle much more of a parsing one than necessary.\n\n[*] yes I'm aware that *some* C-derived languages can handle comma separation. But CG is a multilanguage platform, puzzles have to strive for the common denominator.\n\nHTML: I'm afraid this doesn't get a pass. Puzzles have to be self-contained; external links are tolerated for \"culture\", but not as a requirement to solve the puzzle. I could actually turn it against you: if you're not able to describe the HTML to table coordinates algorithm, are you sure *you* know HTML tables? From my memory of when I did HTML, it shouldn't need more than three sentences.\n\nSplitting: Indeed, much better, thank you!\n\nNits: Great, thank you!",
