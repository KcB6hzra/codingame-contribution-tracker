    "content": "I choose such numbers for the \"9 5 6 - *\" example that only the correct way of calculation will give the \"-9\" result, thus this is a self explanatory example and should be enough even for Reverse mode and one can identify which is the correct way from the tests and more explanation is not required, because one cannot get -9 with a wrong way and as there are only 2 operations it is very easy to check every possible way of the given 2 operations in the \"9 5 6 - *\" and see which one gives \"-9\". This is why I was reluctant to add more than one example in the Goal statement. Following your comment I added two more examples in the Goal statement and now there are 3 examples. I hope this makes it easier to quickly identify way of calculation for the Fastest mode especially.",
