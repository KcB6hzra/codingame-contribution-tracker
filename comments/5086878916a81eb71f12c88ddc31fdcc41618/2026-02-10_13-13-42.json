Given a piece of paper and a pencil, any one of us could easily rearrange these expressions to the asked for standard form in no more than probably 2 minutes per expression. It should be easy enough to distinguish the steps of that process and articulate those steps in the form of an algorithm, right? ... Right? ... You might be surprised how much we all take basic arithmetic for granted.\n\nThe author's attention to detail in test case development is absolutely outstanding. The overall concept and design of the puzzle are superb. This is a wonderful opportunity to take the 24 Game to a whole new level and truly explore articulating your understanding of arithmetic as an algorithm!",

    "content": "Ohh that's stupid of me, I did not check that. I'll check out those other puzzles and most likely withdraw mine. Anyway, I had fun solving my own puzzle the last two weeks :-).\n\nOn second thought (but leaving my first thought hanging here as well), after quickly checking the description of those other puzzles:\n- The other 24 game is easier in set-up: you simply have to check whether it is possible or not. (NB, I remember you saying something about binary output on my Clash-of-code 24-game submission)\n- Fair point that techniques for the puzzle I propose are also partly covered in those other two puzzles.\nI did have however fun in having to combine all those tools, and discovering along the way that each time it was not yet perfect. Knowing the 24-game, the premise was easy (I want to know all unique solutions), but it proved a real puzzle to get there. This is less so the case with the puzzles you referred to. Possibly, other codingamers would also enjoy to go 'all the way' on this one.\n\nSo, as you suggested, I am also going to await other approvers' opinions on the uniqueness. But, I will anyway shift the difficulty of this one to 'hard' (it is clearly more difficult than the medium 24-game puzzle you referred to), and I will change the name.",

    "content": "Indeed, besides finding a solution to the 24 game, the bigger challenge is rewriting equations. The seven rules possibly can be written very different (and easier), hopefully some of the community can help with that. But, what it basically comes done to, is to get unique solutions only (eg: 1*(2*3*4) is *of course* the same as 1*2*3*4, and 30-(1+2+3) is *of course* the same as 30-1-2-3, and as 30-3-2-1, ...). Such rewriting comes naturally to us on paper, but by putting it in rules I ended up with those 7. Hopefully some with background in mathematics (or common sense) can help me with rephrasing/rewriting so that it becomes comprehensible :-).\n\nEDIT: I turned it into five rules now, hopefully it is becoming more comprehensible.",

    "content": "Those are two very good points; I changed my solution code and added the suggested case.\n- The two cases of the 24-game were not part of my solutions because I lazily had programmed that brackets could be removed if the result with or without brackets is exactly the same. And, indeed, (24+24)/1-24 == 24+24/1-24. However, I do not like this, so I will change this; I agree with you that those are unique solutions. The 24-game test jumped from 12 to 18 unique solutions. Very good found, apologies for the confusion!\n- The division test case is a very good find; shifting the parentheses to the back in that situation was not yet part of my code, because I had not yet encountered that situation, so thanks for pointing it out. I've now added it as a test case, and changed my solution code so that indeed only 96/1/(2+2) is kept.\n\nYou found two good edge cases; it needed two changes in my solution code, but it only led to different results on those specific cases (the outcome for all other cases is still the same) - so these were truly (and relevant) edge cases, thanks!",

The coming days I'll go over the unique solutions so far covered in the cases with respect to their parentheses/operator sequence, and add some cases covering situations still missing. Because, while we are at it, why not cover it all.\n\nAs for the 2*6+96/8 case: that was a mistake in my code as well. In one of the last stages of code development I moved the replacing of a/b/c/d with the actual values fully to the end of the script - but because of that, the string-comparison of the two parts was not based on the values, but based on the letters a/b/c/d (so, in that case, it compared like a/d+b*d -> 96/8+2*6). I've resolved the mistake, now it gives indeed 2*6+96/8, as it should.",

Does Rule 4: Similar Parts ever apply to the following?\n\n(a+b)*(c-d)\n(a-b)*(c+d)\na/b+c*d\na*d+c/d\n\nYour explanation above makes it sound like you do consider these examples to have \"similar parts\", but my vote is that they are not similar parts because the operators in the parts do not match. To me, similar parts should have identical operators, otherwise the parts can be sorted by operator. If that were true, only when the operators in the parts are identical would Rule 4 come into play.",

    "content": "NB: is there some private message option in Codingame? I could not find it, so I just keep the discussion live here.\n\nI have worked myself through all parentheses/operator combinations; based on that I found two issues that I now have resolved:\n- I had not yet decided earlier on a-b-c*d (or c/d) vs a-c*d-b; I have now decided to include that under rule five (division latest as much as possible -> a-c*d-b). This case is covered by the 'Extra 2' test.\n- I had not explicitly decided on the (a-b)*(c-d) sorting case - I have for now decided (against your vote) to extent the reach of rule 4 to all (a+-b)*(c+-d) and a/*b+c/*d cases. I opt against operator sorting in those cases for now, because that would either require an additional rule, or it would require to become part of rule 5 - but then the order of the rules needs to be changed (because, at this moment, I see rule 5 as 'in any other case', while with also extending it to the ()*() or ..+.. cases it would interfere a bit with the territory of rule 4). \n\nI've rephrased the statement a bit, which hopefully describes those matters clearly. While for now I opted against your vote, feel free to change my mind - most importantly there need to be consistent rules, precisely what those rules are is a bit arbitrary.\n\nBased on my parentheses/operator administration, there are still 39 situations not covered (but, on trying them, my current code resolves them all according to the rules). On my to-do list is to add a couple of cases that efficiently cover a bunch of those, but I have decided not to aim to cover ALL, because there are quite some combinations for which the four values only have that single combination as solution (so, that would require to add +20 cases, eg 10 tests and 10 validators,, which I think is a bit too much). Apart from adding 2-3 cases that cover multiple of the as of yet not present, I will add one or more cases concerning the latest edges we found (the a-c*d-b sorting, and a couple of different situations for which rule 4 applies).\n\nAfter having added the cases, I will carefully check the order of cases again. I'd prefer to have the 24-game case as final case (in the spirit of the game), but it might not be the hardest one anymore.",

Possibly, if before starting on the puzzle I had realized that it took so many parsing, I would not even have started it. I naively started on it and along the way discovered more and more complexities, and soon had put so much time in it that it felt a shame not to finish.\n\nAnyway thanks for the reply!",

    "content": "Thanks as usual, but extra thanks for this one; I am curious whether at the end it will get approval, but you definitely are a big help to giving it the best shot. I've implemented all your suggestions. As for the title, good point, it can be more interesting. I did change it now, but are still not fully satisfied with it; I might change it later on when a better idea comes to mind.\n\nWhile I have your attention, let me ask you another question:\n- I think with the current output, error solving might be challenging (if you simply find too much solutions, you will only see that you have the wrong number, but you do not yet get info on precisely which expression(s) you need to change). I am thinking whether it would be better to turn the output into one line (so, ns and the expressions comma+space separated, like '2: 2*2*2*3, 2*3*(2+2)', or to simply put all answers in the statement. Any opinion on that?",

    "content": "Thank you for your comment :D\n\nFirst about your question: When I was typing my previous comment, I actually had thought about suggesting to output the unique solutions directly without the need to output the number of solutions. But then I realised that it would be useful to compare that number first, so I didn't suggest that.\n\nAnd back to your question: As the first possible error a player may make may very well be the number of solutions, it does not really matter whether the solutions are output by line or comma-separated.\n\nThe output format may or may not help if the error made is the solutions themselves (e.g. wrong order or not removing unnecessary parenthesis). I mean, it's easier to debug to compare in full, whereas CG's error stream just shows the point at which the actual output starts to differ from the expected output.\n\nAlso, as this is a Hard puzzle, I believe the player will be experienced enough to understand where they can look up the full expected output in the appropriate place. Outputting all the solutions by separating them with commas does not look good. It may be even harder to read when trying to debug offline.\n\nSo, my feeling is that the current output format is good as it is.\n\nI've got a few comments after a fresh look at the revised version:\n\nGoal section\n* The very first example of 3+(6*5-9): maybe change it to another example that really needs parenthesis?\n\n* Rule 1: Suggest to change the example from 3*4*5*6 to 1*2*3*4 so that it also evaluates to 24 :wink:\n\n* Sorting multiple unique solutions: You don't need the outer set of parenthesis in \"a+((b+c)/d))\". Is there really an example of this rule? It seems that no output in any test or validator requires overlapping parenthesis. (Also, the parenthesis are not balanced in the example :P)\n\nInput section\n* Please delete the space character in \"space -separated\".\n\nTitle\nWow, game over, haha. Some more suggestions for your consideration: \"24 Mega Game\", \"Super 24 Game\".\n\nBy the way, it usually takes a longer time to get a Hard game reviewed, tested and approved, so be prepared that it may be on the pending list for a few months.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "- Ok, I'll leave the output as it is for now, thanks for weighing in!\n- I have changed the incorrect / too much parentheses / not evaluating to 24 examples.\n- On sorting, and the case of overlapping parentheses: indeed, the example I gave is bad, in none of my tests/validators this case happens, and I cannot think of any good example. In fact, all examples in which I accidentally used this, could be rewritten to less parentheses. It probably has to do with something like this: brackets are only needed when */ are mixed with +-. However, mixing highest level +-and lower level */ also does not require brackets [3+(3*3) is simply 3+3*3]. A situation of overlapping brackets would imply three levels [L1(L2(L3))], but you cannot create three levels without having at least once +- -> */. So, always on one of the levels the brackets can be removed [Either a+(b*(c+d)) -> a+b*(c+d) or a*(b+(c*d)) -> a*(b+c*d)]. Probably someone with a proper background in mathematics can explain this much better.\nBut, long story short, this means that probably all those situations can be skipped from my solution code as well (i.e. I struggled on some parts that were not needed at all :-)).\nActually, I just tested it (in my code, I've distinguished 11 bracket situations, but situations 2,3,8,9 are those with overlap): not evaluating those situations gives exactly the same result (*of course*). EDIT: just changed the solution code accordingly, it now works with 7 distinct bracket cases.\n- Title: if I have multiple months anyway, hopefully I will come up with a better one. Thanks for the heads up on the review time, I'll try to curb my impatience.",
