To solve without timing out, requires creating a graph and some rational trial and error if not full-fledged constraint propagation. I'm not crazy about all the different symbols used to denote edges, which I was able to treat as being equivalent, but I guess a little ascii art never hurt.",

    "content": "Yay! 👏\n\nNew comments:\n\nGoal\n* Please change \"an horizontal\" to \"a horizontal\".\n\n* Please change \"borderline\" to \"border\".\n\n* How about a diagonal border? Like in the last validator? Should \"a vertical or a horizontal border\" be simply changed to \"a border\"?\n\n* I think it's better to mention a \"partially shared border\" instead of \"superposed corners\".\n\n* If we do not mention \"vertical\"/\"horizontal\", the second last paragraph regarding \"/\" and \"\\\" may be removed (it sounds bit odd that / and \\ behave like | anyway).\n\nCases\n* The input contains the \"_\" character. Please change that to \"-\":\n  • Test 7 (\"Draws\")\n  • Validator 7 (\"Draws\")\n\n* Shouldn't the answer to the last validator (\"More Colors\") be 2?\n\nThanks.",

This is because of the diagonals... \n\nThanks for all these tips !",
