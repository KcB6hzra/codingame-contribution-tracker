I think the focus should be placed on the decoding process instead.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "That's not an explanation. That's just an example, which is very useful actually, but still not enough.\n\nI would suggest to add a few points e.g.\n• The given array of integers represents the shift(s) that have been applied to the original string.\n• Apply the 1st shift to the first character, the 2nd shift to the second character, etc.\n• Cycle through the array of shifts repeatedly. That is, when the end of the array is reached, go back to the beginning.\n• If a shift is <<positive>>, <<encoding>> a character with that shift means moving <<forward>> in the alphabet. <<Negative>> means moving <<backward>>.\n• Your job is to <<decode>>. That means the direction will be reverse of the above.\n• Only the 26 alphabet letters are considered. If you reach the beginning/end of the alphabet while shifting, wrap around and go to the other end to continue.\n\n*****\n\nOther comments\n* As I said before, please remove the quotation marks in the input string as they mean extra parsing.\n* I think it may be a bit difficult for Reverse mode. I'd suggest to remove it, but it's up to you. Also let's see other moderators' opinions.\n\nThank you.",
