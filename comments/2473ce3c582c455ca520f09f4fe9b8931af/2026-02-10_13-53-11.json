    "content": "This is interesting, but I think it's a bit too convoluted. Here are some of my problems with it:\n\nFirst, there are really two separate puzzles in here: the deciphering of binary numbers, and the formatting and display of a grid of numbers. They aren't really thematically connected to each other, and it feels like I'm just solving two separate puzzles.\n\nThe output format isn't obvious until I look at the example, but in the IDE, I can only see a single example, of a 2x2x2 grid. I didn't realize that you were expecting symmetrical dimensions (1x1x1, 2x2x2, 3x3x3, etc.) until I looked at multiple examples.\n\nThe 0-bit test isn't at all intuitive (at least not to me), and if you get it wrong in the IDE, it doesn't really show you what is expected.",

There's no need for the special case for 0 (0^3 = 0, that's no number at all (this fits) and zero volume hence no cube at all (this doesn't)). There's no reason for the front right vertical edge to obscure other edges but not numbers.\n\n(and that leading period is still ridiculous, but that's not your fault)",

I can't remember which size it is, but there was a rounding error I encountered which caused a cube to display one level lower.  I guess it's not important anyway so I'll drop that bit out too.\n\nWith the vertical edge going over other edges but not numbers, that was just a choice in style that I thought looked best, as it is technically over everything, but you still want to see the numbers :)",
