    "content": "Really? I never understood why people would treat Shortest mode as scarier than Fastest mode.\n\nIf it's a hard clash, then just forget about golfing and see if you can solve it in time. You'll probably end up coming in the top 50% even if your code is ungolfed. And if you happen to finish with spare time, then you can golf it afterwards. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nHonestly, I find Fastest way scarier, because every second counts. Whereas with shortest, I can usually take it slow.",
