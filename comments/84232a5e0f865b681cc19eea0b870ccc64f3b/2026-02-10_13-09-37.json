    "content": "@Silver, Nice Clash! It initially looked hard to me... I assumed that you had to make the \"2 numbers in binary representation\" actual binary numbers with the \"0b\" pre-fix, but then I tried just multiplying them as they were given and felt good until Test 2. I was really scratching my head over how to solve this problem... I'm still quite unsure. 🤔\n\nNow there are just some simple issues that I'd advise fixing before going on. Here are my thoughts...\n\nSTATEMENT:\nThe statement is extremely clear. So that's fine.\n\nINPUT:\nYou have written \"2 numbers in binary representation\", but in the solution code you have called the numbers \"number_1\" and \"number_2\"... quite appropriately. I would advise changing your input description like the text below:\n\n<<Line 1:>> [[number_1]] in binary representation\n<<Line 2:>> [[number_2]] in binary representation\n\nPutting the <<>> around text will make them appear in bold and the [[]] around text will make them appear as variables, which will make it simpler to read.\n\nOUTPUT:\n\nI'd suggest changing the description to something clearer like: \n\n\"<<Line 1:>> The product of [[number_1]] and [[number_2]], which is also in binary representation.\"\n\nThis would improve the clarity of the description.\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\nBlank is good and fine.\n\nTEST-CASES:\nSix is a good amount of cases, but if you'd like to add more then it will be more for other coders to work with and higher chance for them to work out how to solve.\n\nOTHER TOPICS:\nPlease remove the duplicate contribution at the link that @5DN1L has given.\nPlease consider my advice.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nA few improvements that will hopefully help you. Please consider making the specified changes. Your clash is very good @Silver, and I will approve once this contribution is fixed and published for approval... but there are some issues still to work through.\n\nThanks and Happy Coding!\nCode-Parser",
