    "content": "Some semi-offtopic questions:\nIs it possible to have the IDE test cases be visible like on normal puzzles? I know we can just re-print the input that we got in order to see them, but that's still not as convenient as just seeing them in the IDE.\nAlso, I think I have \"advanced mode\" or wassname enabled, but I don't get the tab where we can enter our own test case. I've seen that tab on other complicated turn-based games, usually allowing you to enter a seed or some other config vars for the test case.\nLastly, is it possible instead of a simple pass/fail evaluation, to get a \"score\" and a leaderboard so that those who solve the test cases in less moves are ranked higher?\n\n(Even without any of these, I'd still approve the puzzle when you say you are done with the debug mode and other improvements that you planned.)",

A BFS should not work.\n\nThe differences with the other puzzle are:\n- Difficulty: in the other puzzle, there are at most 9 tiles, you don't need a smart heuristic to solve this.\n- Variable board size: I decided to use a board size that is not too easy, nor too difficult. I don't wanted to add this extra complexity that is trivial to implement for people able to solve the puzzle entirely. I want them to focus on the algorithm instead.\n- Solution: I want the list of actions to solve the puzzle and not only the count. That's mainly useful for the viewer actually.\n- I used \"0\" instead of \".\" for the empty place: that slightly simplifies the stub...\n- The final position of the empty slot is not at the same place: This doesn't change the algorithm, but it simplifies the code to test if a puzzle is solved (if the grid is a 1-d array, index == value means solved).",
