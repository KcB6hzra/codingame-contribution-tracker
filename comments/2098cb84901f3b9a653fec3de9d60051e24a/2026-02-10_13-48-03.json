    "content": "The best brute-force algorithm has the complexity of O(sqrt(AB)). If you wanted to render the brute-force solution unusable, AB would have to be 10^20, which is around 2^66, which would require an over-64-bit number data structure. It's hard to discard brute-force where the best (non-brute-force) solution is O(1) (like here). I'd say when it comes to CoC, there's no need to ban brute-force if it works. That's why I approve your contribution.",

    "content": "I feel like it is too simple since this is the basic idea of Alpha  Beta discriminant problem. It is easy to just form 2 equations (a+b)^2 and (a-b)^2 and use S and P to solve each so we know what the values are. That being side I think its great for Clash of Code since the whole point of a Clash of Code is to do it the fastest. In this case, I could do it with a single print statement and two formulas:  A is equal to the square root of S to the power of 2 - 4p all of which -2 all of which is over 2. B = square root of S to the power of 2 - 4p all of which +2 all of which over 2.",

    "content": "Hi! First of all, i didn't even need to brute force it to complete all the tests. What you have here is a simple quadratic equation to solve. I solved it with a simple formula and an if statement. I'd increase the bound to prevent brute forcing and provoke a timeOut. It's a nice problem for a clash of code. However, you need some criteria about what the order should of A and B should be. Sum and multiplication are commutative operations so there has to be some care to  be taken there. \nHere you have the formulas to get A and B\n\n    A = (s-math.sqrt(s**2-4*p))/2\n    B = p/A\n\nBut the output order part is missing though",

That would make it more interesting, and much harder. \nProblem is, I calculated a formula to find A and B, and using it seems to be slower than a for loop, even with way bigger numbers.  That, and depending on the language it may or may not be a better choice for code golf.",
