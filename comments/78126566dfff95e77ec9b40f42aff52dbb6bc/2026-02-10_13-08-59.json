I reacted by PM; for some reason your current code can deal with the row-order of tests 13/15/17 but not of validators 14/16/18.\n\nThe intent of all cases (for Rummikub 1 and Rummikub 2) is that tests and validators are very much similar - except that the rows are in a bit of a different order, and tile number / colors are (consistently) changed. The number of steps and kind of steps required for test and validator is in all cases identical.\nIn other words: you actually surprise me (again) with writing code that passes tests but not corresponding validators. At this moment my assumption is that also for any future such issue, it can only because of row order.\n\nAnd, I expect that this order problem you now encounter will have to be solved anyway for later tests/validators as well, so I expect it is not something that will creep up only in validators. If for some reason in later tests/validators you see similar behavior (passing tests but not validators), then I will mix a couple of the tests and validators around to get the order problem also in the tests. But that is statistically unlikely, given that I randomly shifted the row orders around.",

The COMBINE action leads to the merging of two runs into one run. \"The new run gets the lowest rowid ([[rowid1]]), the other rowid ([[rowid2]]) becomes unused.\"\nEg:\n1 3G 4G 5G\n2 6G 7G 8G\nCOMBINE 1 2\n1 3G 4G 4G 6G 7G 8G\n[2 becomes unused]\n\nCOMBINE makes a row disappear. The \"highest rowid that existed + 1\" is for the case of the creation of an extra row: a 'split' action. In that case, I did not want the extra row to get a rowid that was earlier used for something else, for table visuality (row x in output will either be the original row x, a changed row x due to added/taken tiles or COMBINE, or it will be unused - it will never be a completely other row). I just want a kind of autistic 'COMBINE makes a row disappear, split makes a new row appear', without those two interacting.",

Actually, I came up with the rule on combine priority for the situation where you have to combine two times (for example, rows 1G 2G 3G, 4G 5G 6G, 7G 8G 9G, where you can combine 1 2 and then 1 3, but also 2 3 and then 1 2). The case you built (and that I have tried to honor) is instead about multiple options for a similar action. That brings us into a direction I am not sure I fully like (I fully left out the duplicate rows or the option to take a tile from multiple rows and that you have to pick one of them, because, if I would include that it would warrant a whole load of new cases, and the dynamic it tests is not really about Rummikub anymore, but on consistent row selection).\n\nI am fine with including this Combine priority case (I altered the combine priority rule a bit by adding 'COMBINE 2 6 before COMBINE 3 4'), but it opens a new area (testing to choose between rows 1 2 versus 3 4, but also 1 4 versus 2 5 and 1 6 versus 2 3) that I do not want to enter any further than this.",
