    "content": "Interesting clash, but it is harder than it should be.\n\nI've made some edits to the statement to make it clearer:\n\n\"Given a time [[T]] (<<12-hour format, HH:MM>>) a number [[H]], and a number [[M]], output the smallest angle between the <<hour hand and minute hand according to [[T]]>>, the <<hour hand according to [[T]] and hour hand according to [[H]]>>, and the <<minute hand according to [[T]] and minute hand according to [[M]]>>.  All angles should be in degrees.\n\n<<NOTE:>> For every minute, the hour hand will also move an equal distance to the next hour value.  For example, given a time [[T]] of 09:15, the angle of the hour hand will NOT be horizontal.  [[H]] and [[M]] are independent, so when calculating the angle between the hour hand according to [[T]] and the hour hand according to [[H]], consider the time to be [[H]] o'clock.\"\n\nI also edited the stub generator so that H and M are input as integers rather than 'string(2)' as before.\n\nThis is still quite a hard clash, even with a clear statement.  In my clash just now, I was the only human player to solve it and it took me over 10 minutes. https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/413115343dd7d395caa708411d3fb90f4ca5446",
