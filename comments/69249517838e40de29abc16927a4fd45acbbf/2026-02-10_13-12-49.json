    "content": "The clash seems illogical: Why would the elevator change directions several times in Billy's SINGLE trip? For example, in \"Going underground\" test, Billy starts on floor 7:\n• The elevator first moves down: 7 → 4 → –2 → –5\n• Then it moves up: –5 → 2\n• Then it moves down again: 2 → –1\n• Then it moves up again: –1 → 0\n\nWhat elevator logic is that? Does Billy even press the button for the floor he wants to go?\n\nAnd remember: the elevator does *not* have to move to the floors in the same order of the buttons being pressed. For example, if the elevator is on its way to move up to floor 8, and somebody enters on floor 2 and presses 7, I bet most elevators will stop on floor 7 instead of moving to floor 8 first and going down to floor 7 again.\n\nAnd the [[n]] buttons have already been pressed when Billy enters the elevator. I cannot imagine why the elevator would still change directions a few times while Billy's there.\n\nAlso, please change the following:\n\nInput section\n* \"Next Lines\" to \"Next [[n]] Lines\".\n\nConstraints section\n* [[n]] cannot be negative. Please split the constraint into two.\n\nThanks.",
