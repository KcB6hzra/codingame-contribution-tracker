It is clear that you do not need to walk further than the edges of the clouds.\nSorry for being so picky... This was a really fun problem to solve, and I'm ready to approve it as soon as I have your opinion on the above.",

(and as far as I'm concerned, using (X,Y) coordinates instead of (i,j) defaults to a right-handed system; probably that's just cultural).\nSuggestion: BOTH specify directions and match {(X,Y) <-> right-handed} ; {(i,j) <> left-handed}\n\nMinor complaint 2: could we have S/D for ASCII-art path endpoints instead of @/X? (especially 'X'). (was a problem for me before the coordinate thing sorted out because too big a part of example 1 is top/down symmetrical)\n\nRequest 3: I don't think it actually happens in the cases, but my code kind of depends on clouds' W/H not being zero. Could the constraints please reflect that?\n\nFood for thought 4: would \"worst case\"-like cases be in order? (I'm thinking whirlpool and nethack-style actual maze)\n\nFood for thought 5: I'd love to see bigger scale variants of that. Possibly going beyond the horizontal/vertical boundaries limitation. Not sure how to properly go around the input size limitation there :/ A solo game maybe?\n\nPraise 6: great puzzle!\n\nFor information (not necessarily action, I'm not too sure in a way or the other), my overcompressed version fails validator 4 but not the matching test (also tests Small Map 3 and Large Map 1 (but not validators), but those are later).",

Anyway I think I clarified the statement and addressed your complaints.\n\nBecause the actual puzzle does not resides in the pathfinding part, I would not consider mazes or such as worst case scenarios (that's actually why I did not create such case). Technically the complexity only depends on the number of clouds.\n\nI don't think I understand your last paragraph.",
