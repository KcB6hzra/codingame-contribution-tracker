    "content": "When I was solving this puzzle, my thought process was like this:\n- each new pillar after the first one adds another D to the total distance\n- each new pillar after the second one adds another W to the total distance\nSo the final expression in the solution should be (N-1)*D + (N-2)*W\n\nBelow is some pseudo-graphics which should help to see that this solution is correct.\n\n| |  D  |W|  D  |W|  D  | |\n\n| |  D  |W|  D  | |\n\n| |  D  | |\n\n| |   -   This seems to also be possible according to the constraints section saying that N can be equal to 1. What should be the answer in this case though?\n\nHere is the list of things that I think should be fixed according to the guidelines:\n1. Use the correct solution.\n2. Decide whether you really want N to be able to equal 1. Probably not, because the puzzle doesn't make much sense in this case.\n3. Validator #1 should probably use N = 2 to match the test, because N = 2 is an edge case for which some players will be making mistakes. The test/validator #2 should probably both use N = 3, as it is the next edge case where D comes into play. And the rest couple of tests/validators can be using any bigger N's. As for D and W, I think it's fine for these to have any values as long as D != W != N (to filter out those attempts where players mix them up).\n4. Correctly re-calculate output for all the tests/validators.\n5. The statement probably doesn't need the word \"centimeters\" because it isn't used anywhere else in the statement and it doesn't really matter what units are used.\n6. Also, as was pointed out in the comments below, it would be nice to rephrase the statement a bit to make it clearer that the player should calculate the distance between the edges of the two outmost pillars, not between their centers or something.\n7. It would also be nice to add some comments to the stub, reminding players what N, D and W are, and what should be in the output.\n\nOtherwise this is great idea for a CoC puzzle. I like it!",
