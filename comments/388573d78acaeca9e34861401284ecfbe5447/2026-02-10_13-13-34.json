    "content": "Very nice puzzle! I solved it, and I am willing to approve, but first some suggestions:\n- I got quite confused by the +INF. It took me a while to understand that I do not need that at all - it is simply to make that any point within the ball is a string of equal length to center. Maybe the statement becomes easier to understand if you do not even discuss the case of different string lengths, and simply state that a ball consists of points being strings of equal length to the center?\n- Anyway the length discussion ('length la, lb...') confused me at first because I mixed up distance and length in my head. That might be my stupidity, but the previous point might also resolve this.\n- The three given examples could maybe be made more explicit to clarify the 'sum of the pairwise...' part. Something like: 'd(\"ab\", \"ac\") = d(\"ac\", \"ab\") = d(\"a\", \"a\") + d(\"b\", \"c\") = 0 + 1 = 1\"\n- Based on the single Test 1 example, it was still hard to get a grasp on what the task was. Maybe include a more explicit description of that example in your statement, something like: 'radius 1, center \"a\": there are two points in this string ball: \"a\" and \"b\", since d(\"a\", \"a\") and d(\"a\", \"b\") are <= 1.' And, possibly even include an example with a two-character-string center.\n\nBy the way, down in the comments, I thought about the difficulty level. I found it not easy, but maybe if you agree with and implement above suggestions, the task at hand becomes overly clear and solving it becomes more *easy*.",

    "content": "Outstanding puzzle! I see you recently changed this from Medium to Easy. I think some folks might fight you on that, but I agree with Easy. I get it that recursion is never as easy as basic string manipulation, but this puzzle is pretty straightforward and allows the puzzler to test their knowledge of recursion without adding tremendous complexity.\n\nA few comments:\n\nI like title case for titles: String Balls (I like the puzzle a lot more than the name, but I haven't thought of anything better yet...)\n\nI also like title case for test and validator names, but that's not critical of course.\n\nI love your goal section. Very well done. The only part that you might look at rewording is \"for i in range(la)\". The rest of your write-up sounds very generic and/or mathematical. This one phrase seems very Python. Maybe something like, \"for all index values (i) from 0 to la-1\".\n\nVery well done!",

I've managed to get a solution for something up to validator 9 (excluding validator 8 by the way - for some reason my solution passes test 8, test 9 and validator 9, but times out for  validator 8 - as well as for 10 and 11 of course). I find it hard to get my head around how to optimize my solution further.\nWhen I get there, I will post some remarks regarding statement clarity, but for now I'd say the difficulty for me is *not* easy.",

    "content": "So, here's where I'm at. I'm not sure I like the idea of a Part 1 and Part 2. I kind of think this is a single puzzle. - very high level medium. You start at the beginning and then your test cases lead the CodinGamer down a wonderful path of discovery that ends up somewhere in the vicinity of:\n\nradius = 12500\ncenter = 'codingameisthebestsitetopracticeyourcodingandthatistheabsolutetruth' * 10\n\nanswer = 993512073\n(<1500 ms by the way)\n\nTwo of my absolute favorite puzzles recently are:\n\nhttps://www.codingame.com/training/medium/cylinders\nhttps://www.codingame.com/training/medium/counting-squares-on-pegs\n\nI think you puzzle finishes out this trifecta. Your puzzle is a wonderful exercise in algorithms and optimization with a fun little catch at the end.",
