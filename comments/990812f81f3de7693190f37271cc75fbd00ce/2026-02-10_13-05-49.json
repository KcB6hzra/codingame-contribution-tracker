    "content": "This is cool, but I think it's very hard and a bit ambiguous for Reverse. (It's currently only enabled for Reverse mode, but you have a statement, which is not recommended for Reverse, is this meant to be Fastest?)\n\nThis took me 10 minutes under Reverse conditions. It was easy enough to get the idea, but I coded for rectangle at one point assuming they would be tested, but realised it's only ever 'squares', 'triangles' or 'round shapes'.\n\nI think this would be hard enough even with the full statement. I think most clashers would struggle to differentiate between round and triangle under time constraints.\n\nIt is solvable in 5 minutes though if you see the simplest pattern to differentiate them straight away. I'd approve this for Fastest and Shortest, but I think it's a bit ambiguous for Reverse, unless you add more test cases to make it clear that rectangles won't appear and also that [[n]] will always be greater than 1. [[n]] = 1 would of course be an evil edge case for which there is no wrong answer really. It's best to have the statement so that clasher's can be assured of the scope of the problem. :)",
