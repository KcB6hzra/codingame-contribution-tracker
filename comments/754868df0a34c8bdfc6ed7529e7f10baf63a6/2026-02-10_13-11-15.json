The only caveat I have is that Validator 6 is testing for \"lacking a coordinate in the input\", not matching the corresponding test. Although this won't matter much because it is also tested in the testcase right after.\n\nI also, like @Timinator, do not remember seen a puzzle similar enough to question the originality, even if computing a vector difference and a distance is not precisely a novelty.",
