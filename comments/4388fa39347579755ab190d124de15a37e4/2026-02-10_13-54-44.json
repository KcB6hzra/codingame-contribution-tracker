Please.\nReworded a bit too, as UP and DOWN are likely going to be more readable in many situations as +/-, especially if you double - use as a punctuation mark.\n\nAnd approved, because it now mostly fits all the rules, and who am I to refuse free XP.\n\nBut I'm certainly not upvoting. This problem would be so much more interesting if it \"Lots Of Steps\" actually meant \"a lot\". Like 2^63.\nIt would be so much more interesting this way that it's actually suspicious it didn't from the start, and make it feel like the statement was lifted from somewhere else.",

    "content": "The problem is with the included solution\n\nIt only attempts to move in the direction towards the desired floor and doesn't see the option of moving away first\n\nAlso I think the test cases could be a little more difficult, for starters being a little closer to the advertised 10,000 floors (though even this bound seems like it could be higher)\n\nAlso expanding on this idea of moving away; you can make a test where you need to move towards and away multiple times before landing on the right floor, such as:\n7 4 3 5 1\n6 moves needed (5->2->6->3->7->4->1)\n\nI'll try writing up a better solution that can find the correct solution to this and hopefully all possible test cases\nI'll overwrite the provided solution later if that's alright with the OP",
