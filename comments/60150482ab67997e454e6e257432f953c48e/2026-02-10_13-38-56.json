Some tests with \"base 2\" and binary numbers help me to find that the first line is the base and the 2nd line are numbers (and again with \"base 16\" and hex digits). When this point is solved, it is not very difficult to find that this is a modulus. \nTest 11 is very useful to know that hex digits are uppercase in output. Thanks for this test.",
