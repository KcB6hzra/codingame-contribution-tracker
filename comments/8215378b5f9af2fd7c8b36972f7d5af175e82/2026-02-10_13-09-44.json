It's a new variation on an old programming example (half-factorials instead of factorials) so it gives users a new experience while not being overly complicated.\n\nThe description is clear and easy to understand, even if a user doesn't know what a half-factorial is. \n\nTesting through Java and C, it works perfectly.",
