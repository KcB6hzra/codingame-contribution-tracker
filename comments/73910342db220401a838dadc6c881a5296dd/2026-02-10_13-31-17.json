Without knowing the rule, I understood that some characters needed to be removed, and I manually came up with the following solution in Python:\nprint(''.join(e for e in s if e not in ',!_()?=0123456789'))\nwhich passes all the test cases. However, some characters (namely those in '.+-*{}') are only present in validators.\n\nI agree that in classic mode, this solution would be considered hardcoded. But in reverse mode, that's not so clear.\n\nIn hindsight, I will trust your experience of Clash of Code if you consider that the generalization is part of the exercise. That seems quite obvious afterwards, but it was a surprise to pass all the test cases and only 25% of the validators.",
