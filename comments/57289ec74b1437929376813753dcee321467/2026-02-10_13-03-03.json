    "content": "Hmmm, very interesting. I wonder if a fast-converging series for pi would work or not. Maybe 1,000,000 digits is too big for that. If there's a nice formula for partial sum of such series then maybe we can truncate the calculation and go straight to whatever digit we want. But of course, if said series involves irrational terms then this idea can go straight to a garbage can.\n\nOn second thought, this probably won't work. : (",

However, the formulas provided only work in base 16. There's apparently a way to get these in base 10 as well, but the cited 2022 article that claims as much doesn't give an explicit algorithm, it just kind of expresses the existence of one indirectly. If it's possible to do a second way then I like the problem a lot more.",

    "content": "It was very interesting to read about how pi can be effectively calculated (following the rot13 hint). I don't agree with the comments that this would not be a great puzzle.\n\nOut of curiousity I tried to solve it in PHP. Local run of test #02 (79k digits) took over 1100sec... I used the standard bcmath library which is rather slow, and each arithmethic operation involves copying the inefficient string representation of the number... I am not sure if the GMP facade would be faster, CG does not provide the gmp library for PHP.\n\nI also wanted to try it out in Rust but realized that CG does not provide any arbitrary precision crate for Rust. I made it work locally with num-bigint crate, but I might miss something because it takes 51 sec (but it spends 98% of this in a single sqrt call)\n\nI cannot approve on CG as I have no working solution on CG platfrom, only local ones.",

Perhaps they discover in the future a shocking use of the billions of computed digits of pi (other that a \"random\" numbers mine).\n\nFinally the educational interest of this puzzle is very weak, in my opinion. I have few interest  in massive computation problem, I'm more interested by algorithms and usage of those algorithms, and I think I'm not alone in this feeling.",

The Nintendo puzzle is the only one I've encountered here like that that didn't at least have a story or some sort of catch. In fact, it has a story.\n3. Although this can be solved with internet searches, it's not interesting at all. It's just not that engaging. IMO, this site is far more interesting than any random collection of programming puzzles in some app made in India because it has Indiana Jones, Captain Kirk, Batman, etc. Regardless of easy or hard, this problem doesn't strike me as much better than on SoloLearn or a thousand other site/apps. Subjectively, of course!",

It modified the original C. formula just to avoid having to use arbitrary precision float in the sqrt() part. It is just arbitrary precision integer sqrt(), although with 2 million digits...\nWhat I don't understand in the example code is where the 70518 is coming from. Why is this the upper limit for the binary split for the C formula to be valid for 1m digits?",
