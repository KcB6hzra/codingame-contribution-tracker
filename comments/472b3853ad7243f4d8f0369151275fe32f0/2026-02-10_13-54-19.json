That means, an input letter is considered a correct guess regardless of case.\"\n\nInput\n* Added \"[[chars]] for\".\n\n* Added \"English\".\n\nOutput\n* Changed \"characters\" to \"letters\".\n\nConstraints\n* Added \"[[entry]] contains uppercase and lowercase English letters and spaces only.\"\n\n* Changed \"len([[entry]])\" to \"length([[entry]])\".\n\n* Changed \"len(list of chars)\" to \"number of letters in [[chars]]\".\n\nDifficulty\n* Changed from \"Hard\" to \"Medium\" in view of the current success rate of 71% (could be even lower, but I'll just lower one level for now).",

    "content": "To elaborate: what was wrong to me is that the statement says: \"at the 6th mistake, the game is over\". Putting more letters than 6 errors means the moderator has let the player continue to provide letters after the game is over. To which one could obviously object \"why not?\", but IMHO if the I/O let you play the game after the game is over, it needs more warning than that.\nOne could also argue for an asynchronous player/moderator link, but, really, no one plays hangman like that.\n\nTo present differently: letters after 6 errors are invalid games. Usually community puzzles try and guarantee valid settings. The common exception is when detecting invalid settings is an interesting part of the problem, but that isn't the case here IMHO. As a telltale sign, no specific \"INVALID GAME\" output is requested.",
