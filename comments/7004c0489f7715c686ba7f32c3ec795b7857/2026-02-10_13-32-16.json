I wrote a test case generator for case #4, so those are the only cases I'm really willing to redo - the other 3 are made by hand, so it's a bit tedious to make.\n- Full strings of hashtags are valid as you can't observe any \"venting\".\n- Regarding issues with true/false style output: That's why the lower bound on N is 5. The probability of guessing all of them is extremely slim.\n- LMAO",
