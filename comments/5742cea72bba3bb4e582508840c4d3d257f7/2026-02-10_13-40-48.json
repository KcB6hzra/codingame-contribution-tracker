Unfortunately, I can't seem to come up with a solution that passes your test cases. :/\n\nI fought with it for a while before giving up and checking how you did it, and I think there's a bug in your solution that must also have been present when you generated the expected outputs.\n\nOn Line 8, you have `k=i[0]+i[1]`; this grabs the first and second digits for the 01 -> $@ transformation, but the problem statement says to perform this operation on the first and *last* digit, not the second.\n\nPlease let me know if the issue is in my understanding of the problem rather than your code. Either way, looking forward to approving this one once that mystery is solved. :)",
