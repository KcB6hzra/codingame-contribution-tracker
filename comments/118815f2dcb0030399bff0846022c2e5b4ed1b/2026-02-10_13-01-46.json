    "content": "This problem lacks depth and creativity. It essentially boils down to extracting the second-to-last element from a comma-separated list, which is trivial and doesn't encourage problem-solving or algorithmic thinking. The constraints are also arbitrary and unnecessary—restricting numbers to the range (0,32) serves no meaningful purpose. Furthermore, the problem statement attempts to be engaging with its conversational premise, but it feels forced and disconnected from the actual task. Adding game modes like \"Fastest\" and \"Shortest\" doesn't improve the problem, as the solution is already straightforward with minimal variation. Overall, this problem feels more like a basic string manipulation exercise rather than a meaningful coding challenge.",

    "content": "Thank you for your honest feedback. I totally agree with you that the task is completely trivial in some programming languages which handle string manipulation very well (such as Python), but it is less obvious (at least to me) how one would solve this in a lower language such as C, especially in \"Shortest\". The constraint is somewhat arbitrary but restricts the length of substrings (to two characters max). I could remove it, but I thought it is nice to have.",
