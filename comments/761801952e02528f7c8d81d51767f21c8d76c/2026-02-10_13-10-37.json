    "content": "I really like this clash, but it feels a bit on the hard side to complete within 5 minutes. I only know Python and happen to know about itertools.permutations: does every language have such convenient access to permutations? I was able to complete in 5-6 minutes, but only because I use that import. I'd be happy to approve if someone can confirm that players of all languages should be able to get all permutations in under a minute.\n\nAnd one remark: I accidentally wrote code that checked only for a better 'high'  value with A + B - C / D, and a better 'low'  value with A - B + C / D. Stupid of course (I should check for both high and low in both situations), BUT my code passed all tests except validator 4. In other words, could you make sure my code would also fail at a Test (not only at a Validator)? In a real clash I would have had no idea why I did not get 100%.\n(7 9 0 3 is currently the only case in which the low  value is found with A + B - C / D. 6 9 0 3 would have the same behavior, so changing 'A Zero! Test' into 6 9 0 3 would do the trick.)",

You don't actually need to permute the operator positions as long as you test those two variations, since other permutations are redundant.\n\nI might re-do my code without eval later, to confirm it's not too hard.\n\nBut if it's generally seen to be too hard, then I will submit as a puzzle with the full rules (which includes square root and multiplication operations). :)",

Thanks for the bug report, I hate when I get 100% on tests but not validators!\n\nYeah, I can see this is on the hard side, but I figure that the number of permutations is only 24 (4!) for each of the 2 equations, so it shouldn't be too hard to just iterate through all permutations with either a recursive or iterative solution, i.e. without needing a function for permutations.\n\nIt's definitely harder than most clashes, but I'd say that the strongest clashers for this type of problem will still be able to solve it in 5 minutes without default libraries. Most people would need more like 15 minutes though, I agree.",

With the hint I give them, I hope they will give solving it a try. :)\n\nOtherwise, I can simplify it further and make it so that it's only the \"Low\" solution that needs to be solved in this clash, but I like the 'Hi-Lo' aspect a lot so I'll see what others think.
