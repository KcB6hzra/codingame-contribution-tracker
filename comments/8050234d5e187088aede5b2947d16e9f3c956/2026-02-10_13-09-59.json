Advent is the fours Sunday before the 25th of December\" and \"Today is the 1st of January\"? I think it just sounds smoother especially because you already said New Year's Day and Christmas.\n\nFinally, I think there's enough information in the parenthesis at the end to make a new section. Same with \"Today is New Years Day\"; I think a few new lines would just structure the entire thing well.",
