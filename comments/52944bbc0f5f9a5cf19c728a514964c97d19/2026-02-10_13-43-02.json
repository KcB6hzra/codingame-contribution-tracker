    "content": "The puzzle is nice for a CoC. However, the statement seems bizarrely long and thus confusing. Shouldn't it just be:\n\n\"Goal: There are [[N]] runners in a race who start at different times [[T]] and run at different speeds [[S]. Determine which runner passes the 100m line last.\"\n\nThe output is also confusing, but it's unfortunately much more difficult to clarify. The best I could do was to add some extra whitespace and to be careful about sentence syntax (which matters a lot). The most important addition is mentioning that the runners are 0-indexed.\n\n\"<<Line 1:>> Two space separated integers [[I]] and [[F]].\n[[I]] is the index (0-based) of the last person to cross the 100m line, or {{-1}} if more than one person crosses last or nobody crosses at all.\n[[F]] is the time in seconds since the race began that the last person crosses the 100m line, rounded up, or {{0}} if nobody crosses.\"\n\nOther notes:\n* I notice that your code uses a ceil() for elapsed time before comparing to the longest time, which is error-prone. It would mean that two runners that start at the same time but run at 15 and 16 m/s would both pass the 100m line \"at the same time.\"\n* Speaking of which, who runs at 15 m/s???",

Also you're using the same letter T for both the time they start and the time they finish. A few longer test cases wouldn't hurt. I would consider allowing runners with 0 speed to throw a bit of a curve ball at the solvers :)",
