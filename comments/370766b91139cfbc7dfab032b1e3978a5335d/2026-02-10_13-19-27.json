    "content": "Hi!\n\nFirst of all, I think that the puzzle is very interesting. I liked it a lot!\n\nHowever, I think it is way too hard for a clash. It took me more than half an hour to solve it (around 45 min including reading and understanding the problem). While I may not be the faster programmer around, I don't think that it is possible to solve it in 15 minutes, and forget about the 5 minutes that clashes are supposed to take.\n\nI don't think it is an issue with your puzzle, but with path-finding and optimization in general, which are not that easy to code. Thus, I don't think my suggestions will help a lot, but here we go:\n\n* I would try to simplify the statement, in order to make it easier to read and understand:\n    - Use only '_' for platforms and '#' for empty cells. There is no real difference between floor and platform, so the same symbol may be used. Also, the position for the bowl is given by the coordinates, so there is not need to draw it. \n    - I think the movement pattern of the cat can be clearer on a `monospace` grid representing the cells:\n```\n[ ][ ][+][ ][ ]\n[ ][+][+][+][ ]\n[+][+][C][+][+]\n[ ][+][+][+][ ]\n[ ][ ][+][ ][ ]\n```\n* It would be convenient to specify that the bowl is always reachable.\n\nThese suggestions aim to make it faster to read and understand, but I don't think that they really make a huge different. IMO you should simplify the problem, even if it loses part of the narrative, or make it a puzzle (maybe you can add a second bowl if you think it is too easy right now, but I'd say it is OK)",

    "content": "The puzzle looks interesting!\n\nInput section\n* Please format the six variables inside the brackets too.\n\nConstraints section\n* \"Any kind of move (short or long jump, on the floor or to a platform) counts as one single move.\" This is not a constraint - this is a puzzle specification. Please move it to Goal section.\n\nGoal section\n* Please specify which cell is the origin (x = 0, y = 0).\n* Please specify which directions x and y increase respectively. (In many CodinGame puzzles, x increases when moving from left to right, and y increases when moving from top to bottom instead of from bottom to top.)\n* While \"up to two cells\" is perfectly good English, I am not sure if one may misinterpret it as \"up\" as in \"up/down\" (it still makes sense even when followed by \"in a straight direction\"). I would suggest to change \"up\" to \"at most\". (Not a big issue though, as you've included a graphical representation of where a cat can jump.)\n* A bit odd in the choice of having the first row as the floor (I guess it has something to do with the direction y changes?), as that means the floor is at the top rather than at the bottom in the graphical representation... It doesn't affect the solvability of the puzzle, though.\n\nThanks.",

It's not fun or fair.\n\nThis is a great idea for a puzzle, but for a clash it's way too complicated. If you want people to solve a hard problem in a clash (i.e. pathfinding in a maze), then you can't make it complicated in other ways:\n1. the fact that the cats can jump more than 1 square at a time and move diagonally = very complicated!\n2. the long backstory about the two cats = distracting, takes time to read and wastes precious coding time.\n3. path-finding for two cats = two separate path-finding problems that then need to be compared.\n\nIf you wanted this to be a clash, then it needed to be much simpler and easier for people to immediately focus on trying to solve the difficult problem of double path-finding.
