    "content": "In grid problems, it is not rare to denote x as row index and y as column index (opposite to this problem).\n\nIt means that the output section may cause confusion. So, I think that the statement should at least clarify which is row index and which is column index. (Also, as a convention, it is common to choose r and c as variable name.)\n\nAlso, the output is 0-indexed, but in real world is 1-indexed is more common. It may be preferable to mention that we need to output in 0-indexed.",
