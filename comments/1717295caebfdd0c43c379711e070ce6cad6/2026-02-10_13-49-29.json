I would argue size is necessary because its critical in determining the bounds of the geometry about 0.\n\nAnd you're right here too, I could alter the input to be more terse.  If you feel strongly it should be done that way I'll change it.  However I would argue the current definition potentially requires users to more carefully read the problem requirements as throw order is not tied to initial name order, which I view as a positive thing.\n\nFinally I agree on tests with both JBM and you.  I've altered the tests and validators based on your feedback.  Thanks for your assistance!",
