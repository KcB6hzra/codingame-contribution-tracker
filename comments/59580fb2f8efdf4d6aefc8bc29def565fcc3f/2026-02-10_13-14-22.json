Otherwise the number is shown as an integer instead of a float.\n\nAlternatively, just always require that convertedSpeed is shown with 1 decimal place.\n\nCases\n* Suggest to rearrange the cases so that each pair of test and validator is similar to each other in terms of the conversion direction. There are 8 basic configurations:\n(UD = unit of distance, UT = unit of time,\n G = greater, E =  equal, S = smaller)\n   • GUD + GUT to SUD + SUT\n   • GUD + EUT to SUD + EUT\n   • GUD + SUT to SUD + GUT\n   • SUD + GUT to GUD + SUT\n   • SUD + EUT to GUD + EUT\n   • SUD + SUT to GUD + GUT\n   • EUD + GUT to EUD + SUT\n   • EUD + SUT to EUD + GUT\n\n* Among UD conversions there are two special cases involving only the greatest and smallest UD, i.e. miles to inches and inches to miles.\n\nSimilarly among UT conversions there are two special cases involving only the greatest and smallest UT, i.e. fortnights to seconds and seconds to fortnights.\n\nI would suggest these sepecial cases get paired up by themselves. (not necessarily special UD + special UT; can be special UD + ordinary UT or ordinary UD + special UT. But of course it'll be great to have one pair of special UD + special UT.)\n\nThanks.\n\n... by the way, solution code\n* Not that it matters, but I notice in line 14 that \"seconds\" is in plural while all the other units are in singular :P",

    "content": "Hey Rafarafa -- thanks.\n\nThat puzzle you reference is mildly similar, but it only deals with distances (not speeds), and it's all just multiples of 10, so I think I won't link it.\n\nYou call it \"the American metric system\" but (I learned this only recently), it's actually \"the Imperial System\" and only the USA, Liberia, and Myanmar still use it.\nInterestingly, in the USA, we use metric measures for many things too, so you have to sort of be \"bi-lingual\"... For example, you buy a 2-liter bottle of soda and a quart of milk.  You drive 45 miles an hour and buy 10-milligram pills.  Your doctor measures you in pounds and inches but when he removes a growth, it's in centimeters.\n\nThe ridiculous thing is that in the 1970s (via the Metric Conversion Act of 1975) we (USA) tried to go metric and it just didn't stick.",
