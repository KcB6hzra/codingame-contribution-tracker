    "content": "I've never heard of Core War. I just did some reading on it, and it's a neat idea. For those who don't get the reference, CGFunge is almost a pure subset of a real programming language, Befunge. I have changed most of the characters used, and have also changed the behavior very slightly so that you can't just use a direct copy of an existing Befunge interpreter.\n\nYour comment has my head spinning with possibilities. It sounds like a somewhat more advanced form of the old Sega Dreamcast game, ChuChu Rocket. That could really be fun, and I think there's potential for at least one puzzle based on that idea. I'm going to chew on it a bit more.\n\nI could even see such a beast making a cool multi-player contest.",
