    "content": "You should remove a test case where N is 0 because there are ties: 0^2 = 1^2 - 1^2 => 1 - 1 difference is minimal, grader only accepts \"0 0\"\nRegarding input size: you should either lower N or make it bigger. If some language can brute force the solution easily, while it's impossible or unreliable on another the first language clearly has an advantage. This damages the competitiveness of CoC. Either brute force should be a viable solution or no one should be able to brute force it.\n\nAlso, your solution code is weird: when checking if A * A - B * B == N * N, A becomes very large (25000001 at last test case) which when squared overflows, but it still produces the right answer even though 25000001 * 25000001 is calculated to be 704053377 ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nHere is my C++ solution for reference:\n\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n    int N;\n    cin >> N;\n\n    if(N == 0) {\n        cout << \"0 0\";\n        // cout << \"1 1\"; ?\n    }\n    else if(N % 2 == 1) {\n        int a = (N * N + 1) / 2;\n        cout << a << \" \" << a - 1 << endl;\n    }\n    else {\n        int a = (N * N + 4) / 4;\n        cout << a << \" \" << a - 2 << endl;\n    }\n}",

    "content": "While the constraints make it clear I think it's prudent to emphasize the non-negativeness in the statement. Suggestion:\n\"Given an integer N, find non-negatative integers A and B such that N^2 = A^2 - B^2. If multiple such solutions exist, find the one where A - B is minimal.\"\n\nI tend to make it more math-y than it probably should be, so feel free to change it any way you feel like it. If you go my way then formula is missing from the goal and therefore Input and Output needs rephrasing. Most likely to simply \"A non-negative integer N\" and \"A and B separated by space\", respectively.\n\nSince 0 is added to the mix, constraints need updating to allow that with B <= A.\n\nLastly, a TIOLI comment. I like your test case naming, small numbers written down, but for larger numbers, for tests the number suffices, i.e. \"Test 15\" to \"15\". Validators containing the word Validator in them is always a good idea.\n\nI really like this problem now with a little bit of formatting, I'm happy to give it a go. Good job.",

Secondly, literally the most simply mathematical identity is the only thing you need to use to make this easy, but just a tad more complex, yet still trivial approach can yield a result in no time. Third, there is literally a closed formula for this one that works for everything but 0 (that you can hardcode) which means it is solvable in O(1) in any language that can handle 32-bit integers and the 4 basic arithmetic operations.\n\nAnd lastly my personal opinion. Nothing makes me happier than a problem that doesn't work for Python. There are a 100 problems that are designed in a way that you only have to import some Python lib to call a function and not think. I guess the idea is that the sooner your brain dies, the better. It's a horrible habit and it's already showing in the profession how extereme disadvantage is when you think that's the way to do software development.",

Yes, I know there's definitely better approaches, but op should implement it in their solution then, instead of leaving a solution that is inefficient. I also want the max N to be lowered because I'd suppose people would brute force if they don't know the formula, and even though that's a bad practice, it shouldn't be a 0% if following the author's approach. ( but again, coc is far from relatively good practice)\n1b if there's a formula, then perhaps the author should use it in their solution or mention it in their statement. \n2 \"Nothing makes me happier than a problem that doesn't work in Python\". Are you trying to say a clash that is undoable for like half the community is good? Reminder that coc is not puzzles, so the difficulty should be moderate, and a lot of people use python. If anything importing a lib is actually better than implementing your own algorithm at times because 1 it is shorter ( and yes we are talking about speed and/or code size here ), 2 it probs will be more efficient than the algorithm you implement (or as efficient). I'm not saying its the way to do software development but coc isn't that at all, it's entertainment.",

    "content": "Let me be clear on this one. There a guideline that a CoC should be solvable in less than 15 minutes. If you don't do anything but look at the test cases it's as simple as that to notice the difference between A and B is 1 or 2 based on parity. So the problem really boils down to basic pattern recognition that I would expect an average 12 year old to be capable of.\n\nThere are at least 3 super easy mathematical approaches to use to solve this one. Any of those should be more than feasible in way less than 10 minutes. \n\nHaving just a tad optimized solution that involves no math at all just trial and error and knowing the super basics of programming is viable to solve this. Which proves the point that you tried to validate a problem without even getting a slight thought about it.\n\nThe author should NEVER in any case provide the optimal solution/shortest solution to the problem because that can and will be used by cheaters. I personally asked the author to revert his optimal solution. If you don't know how to cheat it's fine, unfortunately there is a way and I've seen it in actual CoC and that's why I encourage verbose sub-optimal solutions.\n\nAnd lastly. What you say is perfectly valid for languages like Java, C# and others where libraries are written by language experts and maintained by them, too. For Python and Javascript it's an unimaginable pain. The amount of times I've seen customer impacting failures because of some untested, unmaintained dependency was pulled in, and actual code was relying on it is insanely high. Unless it's numpy and matplotlib and alike which are actually good it's a huge red flag. And those are the 0.1% of available libraries. If for anyone it's entertaining to come and copy 3 lines of code with some random magic library that they don't understand at all, I will have bad news no matter which career path they take.\n\nAnd to finish off with a personal opinion. If you come to CodinGame and manage to not learn anything and not develop your skills at all, something went horribly wrong there.",

Of course this doesn't mean python can't solve this...not at all! If someone wants to check the solution afterwards the clash because they had no idea how to solve it, they will want to recode it in their language, and guess what, they'll get timeouts and be like \"bruh ok this isn't solvable my language\".\n\nI also said to lower max N because naive brute forcing attempts (like the current one of the author) shouldn't be timing out that much.\n\nI agree with what you said about libraries, but in the particular case of coc, importing something can be shorter or faster (ie in ruby ill import prime for all the prime related thing instead of rewriting the algorithm).\n\naight as you see, someone else approved it, so my rejection was not useful. congrats on getting a clash approved.",
