    "content": "Very nice. My grandfather used to have an electronic game that did this. I had hours of fun with it as a kid.\n\nI have made some minor edits for grammar, and I added an example to the Statement. Hopefully it clarifies things a bit. Unfortunately, the asterisks look kind of funny in the example because they \"hover\" above the dots, at least in my browser. I kept it that way to go with the test format, though.\n\nI will try to solve the puzzle later. Thanks for an interesting submission.",

    "content": "I noticed that my solution's significantly different from everyone else's, though. I wasn't able to get the 15x15 fast enough in C#. I'm sure it's possible, but I decided to take a different tactic that is based on the \"follow the lights\" strategy. It does a double pass in which the first pass is trivial, but then the pattern for the second pass can maybe take a long time to compute, but in every example I've tried, it finds the solution quite early in the computation process. I don't know enough about to math to prove whether this will always be the case or not.\n\nI still think about this one, and have downloaded a lights-out app for my phone to play with it when I have spare time. Thanks again. :-)",
