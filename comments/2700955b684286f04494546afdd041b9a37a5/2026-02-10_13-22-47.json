    "content": "I don't know much about Latin Squares, so I went online.\n\nThe description doesn't say what makes two Latin Square distinct from each other.  I notice that most resources seem to consider the following two squares...\n\n| 123 | 321 | \n| 231 | 213 | \n| 312 | 132 | \n\n... to be the EXACT same Latin Square.  (The symbols 1 and 3 are exchanged in the right hand square, but the square is the same)\n\nThis is because, in Latin Squares, the symbols being used are usually not considered important, only the patterns!  We could swap 1 for 'Elephant', 2 for 'Green' and 3 for 'Smiley Face' - and it'd still be the same Latin Square.\n\nAnd that's where my confusion comes from :\n\nNumber of 'Latin Squares' != Number of representations.\n\nSo, I found it the puzzle vague in what was being asked for :\n\n1. Count the unique Latin Squares squares (irrespective of their symbols) as most articles on Latin Squares seem to consider appropriate.\n\nor;\n\n2. Count the number of possible symbolic representations, even where they would actually represent the SAME Latin Square (*)\n\nIf you already understand Latin Squares, and are therefore pattern-focused, it seems like the description asks Question 1 ... and if you're new to Latin Squares, or are symbol-focused, it seems like it asks Question 2.\n\nThe given example doesn't clarify, as the answer is 1 in both cases.\n\nOr, am I just being an idiot?",

    "content": "The 9x9 VALIDATOR seems too easy. My python \"brute force\" (recurse by-row, by-column, sum by looping through 1..N: if i is not present in the row or column, call recursively) was too slow for test case 9x9 but passed the validator.\n\nFor a medium difficulty puzzle I figured I'd need to optimize something?\n\nSome numbers for the python brute force:\n- 9x9 validator takes 3.4 sec on CG (i guess python has a big time limit?) and 2.9 sec on my laptop\n- 9x9 test case takes 32 sec on my laptop. (can't run it on CG)\n\nTaking some of the digits out of the validator, I get something that runs in 27 sec on my laptop:\n\n9\n087604321\n800000002\n700000003\n600523000\n000372005\n401230006\n300000007\n200000008\n103050780\n\n29312\n\nThis test case shows \"Solved in 89366 us\" in the C++ solution.",

    "content": "The tricky part in this puzzle is that, although it is very compute intensive, it should be doable with slow languages. Imagine that the timings I have are with unoptimized C++. Performance-wise, this represents several orders of magnitude with Python. PHP, Ruby and al. are probably even worse.\nSo I had to nerf my test cases.\nRegarding your specific problem, I think it's really related to your algorithm. With mine, more solutions to find result in longer timings. \nThat said, I really want people to use smart algorithms: your test case seems compatible with an optimized Python implementation and the time frame allocated  to that language.",
