A snake may span across more than one line.\n\nEach snake has a tail ({{<}} or {{>}} depending on the direction), a body (each segment is a {{=}}) and a head ({{o}}).\n\n(* vertical zigzag is possible, hence \"horizontal\" is mentioned.)\n\nConstraints section\n* (I haven't checked but I assume that's the case?) Suggest to add that each snake has at least one body segment (i.e. at least length 3).\n\nStub generator\n* The variable name \"H\" differs from that used in the other sections (\"n\").\n\nCases\n* Perhaps the clash is doable in Reverse if there are easier cases at the beginning (e.g. first pair is just 1 snake, second pair is 1 snake in 1st line and 2 snakes in 2nd line, third pair is 1 snake spanning across 1.5 lines and 1 snake filling the remaining 0.5 line)?\n\nThanks.\n\nP.S.

    "content": "Sorry for the unclarity. What I mean is that for a reverse player, connecting the output to the input is challenging for any longest snake longer than 5 (i.e. counting characters is annoying in IDE). Your first two test/val pairs can be followed because the snakes are on a single line, but your first switching example's longest snake is rather long (11), and the one after that as well (8); I guess that for a reverse player it will be challenging to make the connection that it shifts from left to right while trying to count the '=' characters on his screen.\n\nI cannot anymore clearly check how it is as reverse, because I already know the assignment. But, I think that it is challenging, and I think it gets easier if as third test/val pair you do a switching case with a short (e.g. 5) longest snake, like the one I suggested.\n\nLOL I'm not sure whether I made it any clearer with this. I'm not sure how to say it, but it comes down to: add one or more cases in which the longest snake is still small and hence easily countable for a reverse player.",
