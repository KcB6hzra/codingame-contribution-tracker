Very welcome change from the other clash that was linked to be similar.\n\nI had fun solving this, and after solving it and reading the comments, it's clear to me that it can 100% be solved in 5mins if you know of the quadratic equation and how to apply it here.\n\nIt's also pretty solvable in 5 mins without knowing that same equation.\n\nI had fun solving it. :)",
