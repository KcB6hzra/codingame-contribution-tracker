    "content": "Actually, if all of the polygons are strictly convex, there's an easy way to split the polygon into triangles to solve for the total area. But if some of the polygons were concave, I would know right away that that method wouldn't work and would promptly research the shoelace method instead.\n\nAdditionally, the shoelace method doesn't work for self-intersecting polygons, and the problem statement doesn't describe whether those appear, either. There is a third, more complicated algorithm that works in that case.\n\nShould I, as a solver, assume that your polygons are strictly convex and use the triangles method? Or should I reason that some polygons might be concave and try the shoelace method? Or should I go further and take self-intersecting polygons into account as well? Hopefully that clarifies why I think this is important.",
