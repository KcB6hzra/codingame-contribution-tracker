    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: I like this puzzle a bunch. When I did the puzzle, I didn't know the math that makes it very easy and even now, I still don't understand the math that makes it easy. I chose to do a simulation. My first simulation was far too slow to pass all the test cases, so I had to do a tiny bit of optimization. As far as optimization goes, it was very easy to optimize my solution.\n\nThe reason I share all this is because I believe some reviewers might argue for this puzzle to be medium instead of easy. I'm okay with the easy tag. The simulation approach is probably toward the hard end of easy, but it is a lot easier than many medium level puzzles on CG.\n\nMy bet is that after this puzzle goes live, there will be discussion in the forum about the math. That's fine. It will still be a great little puzzle to practice building a simulation of a relatively small and reasonably simple system.",

For those of us that don’t know the math and opt for simulation, I think it’s important that the validator be easier than the test case when possible. Because of the higher reflectivity in validator 4, it takes a lot longer for the light to dissipate than it did for test case 4. I’m OK with the timing out. I just want it to happen on the test case as compared to the validator.",
