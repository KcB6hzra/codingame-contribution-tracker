It took me around 11 minutes.\n\nYou should mention that there are no \"?\" on the edges, otherwise it will take longer than it was expected.\n\nWhy did you choose yellow for the fourth colour? For a more homogenous puzzle, it was better to include all the remaining colours (purple and orange).\n\nAlso, the spaces between colours added few good seconds to the resulting time.",

It emphasizes the aspect in which they differ, allowing for individual contrast, whereas \"regions of different colors\" would tend to refer to all such regions collectively.\n\nI felt it better to spatially separate Y from X because the shape of the symbols is so similar, but I will use a different fourth color instead and implement your request.

The spaces in particular I can't do much about, if the dimensions are to be clear in the stub code.\n\nI'm using four colors because of the much deeper Four Color Theorem. These four seem to be the most primary, tho I'd probably choose much paler colors for a real map. I just wouldn't want to trip someone up with \"Aqua\" and \"Beige\" e.g.\n\nGood tip, I'll add a note to constraints.",
