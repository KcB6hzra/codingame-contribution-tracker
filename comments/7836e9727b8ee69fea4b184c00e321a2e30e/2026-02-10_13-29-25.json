Do you mean that if ur code is like output Lucky u can get around 50%?\n\nKinda make sense but I think that the aim is to get 100% so  it doesnt matter a lot?\n\nOr how do you suggest me to fix it?\n\n(I think there are some few contribution also have this mistake)",

    "content": "Yes of course one would ideally try to get 100% on clashes, but binary output makes it :\n1. possible to get 100% with rng (the chances are low but relatively high compared to clashes with a lot more different outputs possible)\n2. unfairly rewarding for people that actually tried and gets less than ~50% (considering binary output is just hardcode printing an output)\n\nSadly, a lot of clashes that have binary output are available in CoC because 1. \"moderators\" sometimes don't know the guidelines of contribution (and sometimes don't bother to check) and 2. (iirc) the rule didn't exist some time ago. This is hard to fix because you don't get any reward for \"fixing\" a clash so moderators won't be bothered to do it unless rly necessary IMO.\n***\nAbout your clash, if you can't fix it, that means your clash might just not that good of an idea (which is kinda the case here : the code is a little too easy, just need to check if there's 6 and 8 or no 6 nor 8, not exactly a lot of coding rly). You can either try to put multiple numbers to test for (which is a lazy solution to binary output), or think of something else.",
