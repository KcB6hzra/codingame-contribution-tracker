Each range is defined by two integers Li and Ri, and it means that contains all numbers ranging from Li to Ri, inclusive. -----> Each range is defined by two integers `L_i` and `R_i` and contains all numbers from L_i to R_i, inclusive.\n\n3.

    "content": "Nice puzzle. A bit too tricking in my opinion to understand that the gcd of n numbers is the gcd of previous (n-1) numbers and n, and for whenever there's a range longer than 1 it's automatically gcd one. Kudos to anyone figuring this out in a 15 minute CoC. Also in your code, if li!=ri, why do you do:\ng = __gcd(g, 1LL);\nand not:\ng = 1LL;\n?",
