    "content": "Hi folks. This is my first attempt at a contribution. Looking forward to your feedback.\n\nI suspect this may be a bit too tough for a CoC. Based on feedback I'm thinking of either fleshing it out into a full problem (e.g. could have \"A*B\" type dependencies. Maybe mix operators up (+ and * ). Add cycles or missing dependencies as edge cases to handle.\n\nOr try to simplify a bit but I'm not sure what to do to make it simpler. Changing the dependencies to a letter only would simplify slightly but I'm not sure it's enough.",
