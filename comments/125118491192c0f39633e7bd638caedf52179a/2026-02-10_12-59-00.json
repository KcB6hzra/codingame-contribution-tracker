    "content": "Answered as one of the points below.\n\nGoal / Input\n* A more specific term than \"chemical formula\" should be used, as it may refer to empirical formula, molecular formula, structural formula and condensed formula.\n\nGoal\n* Prefix table: Please format \"n\" as a [[variable]].\n\n* Carboxylic acid: Please delete the extra \"contains\".\n\n* Why is the hydrogen atom in the functional group excluded when counting hydrogen atoms in alcohols and carboxylic acids, but included when counting them in aldehydes? (If you include the hydrogen atom in the functional group, carboxylic acids contain 2n hydrogen atoms too, in addition to alkenes, aldehydes and ketones. See also comment on Example 3 below.)\n\n* I feel that the suffix descriptions provide sufficient information, so the table could potentially be removed. However, others might find the table easier to read, so it may still be worth keeping. If you choose to keep it, please do make the columns narrower by allowing each item to span two rows, as the table in its current layout may not be shown in full in narrower windows.\n\n* Chemical formula: Please change \"it contains\" to \"a chemical formula contains\".\n\n* Please change \"alkane, alkene, alcohol, carboxylic acid, aldehyde or ketone\" to \"any compound type mentioned above\".\n\n* Please change \"All of them contains\" to \"All of them contain\".\n\n* In the example for \"Alkenes vs Aldehydes vs Ketones\":\n  • Please use \"propene\" instead of \"propane\".\n  • Please swap the order of \"propanal\" and \"propanone\".\n\n* Final examples: Please fix the spacing so that a blank line appears between examples instead of within each example.\n\n* Example 2: Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, not CH3CH3COOH.\n\n* Example 3: You may also mention \"ethanoic acid\" in the explanation for comparison, as it shares the same molecular formula (C₂H₄O₂) as methyl methanoate.\n\nOutput\n* Please add \"or {{INVALID}}\".\n\nCover picture\n* Suggest to upload a cover picture for the puzzle.\n\nThanks.",

Thanks again for your help! \n\nRegarding the term \"chemical formula\", I have added the type of chemical formulae that are used in this puzzle and their corresponding definitions. Do you think that's enough? \n\nAlso, the suffix table has been removed as I hit the word limit lol",

    "content": "No problem 😉\n\nThe revised section on chemical formulae looks good to me.\n\nHere are two optional suggestions regarding the updated statement. Feel free to adopt them or not:\n\n* You might consider removing the entire \"Alkenes vs Aldehydes vs Ketones\" section if you incorporate into the \"Suffix\" section that alkenes do not contain any oxygen atoms. That clarification, along with the existing descriptions, should be sufficient to distinguish them without the need for a separate comparison section.\n\n* Regarding the output of {{INVALID}} for chemical formulae that don't match any of the defined compound types, would {{OTHERS}} be a more suitable label? The formulae themselves aren't truly invalid; they just don't fall into the specified categories.\n\nThanks.",
