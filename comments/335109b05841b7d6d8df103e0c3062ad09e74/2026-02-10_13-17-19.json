I found it very annoying to have to look at each of the steps of a 3x3 (or 1x10) array to find one small mistakes in the implementation. \n\nProbably my approach wasn't ideal but I would have loved some small tests at the beginning, specially because in this puzzle manually setting up test cases faces up the problem of python trimming strings ...\n\nJust so I don't only criticize, I suggest this one testcase (basically an easier version of the 2nd test):\n1\n4\n       |    |    |  \n  +----+  --+  --+  \n  |                 \n0 1\n5\n\nIt did help me find a bug in my directions' logic.\n\nAlso, my current solution passes all tests but not the last validator, which apparently is the more demanding one. Since I don't think I did anything particularly clever, people might face this issue once the puzzle is approved. So I'd also suggest to separate the last test/validator pair into two pairs of similar performance requirement.",

Writing down conditions for triggering buttons was probably the crucial part. Recognising the shapes from ASCII was a nice exercise. There's a bit of a gotcha when you go from the \"Validator 2\" test to \"More rotations\", which may or may not be obvious ;) [details in my previous comment]",

    "content": "Finally solved it!\n\nI was initially stuck only passing first 4 tests and couldn't quite figure out why.\nTurned out in each move I was rotating all the affected buttons, including doing it more than once if a given button was triggered by more than one other button. Great recipe for an infinite loop ;) De-duping the list solved the issue. \n\nWould be awesome to have a test which would lead to similar issue and small enough to 'track the execution' manually.\n\nNice puzzle! Other than wasting time and brain cycles because of my silly bug, it was fun. Kinda wish there was a 'warning' in the description that each button can only be triggered once in a given cycle. It hindsight, seems quite obvious though. Maybe figuring it out is part of the puzzle?\n\nThanks!",

I'm slowest on test case 11, but never more than 2700 ms which is no more than about 1/2 way to the timeout limit.\n\nI was sitting in a hotel lobby last weekend at 5am thinking about how I would capture and represent these buttons in my code. For me, crafting a data structure for these buttons was more challenging than many other puzzles. Once I had the bugs worked out of my data structure, the rest came together nicely.",
