Resetting the clock, I started over with a completely new and different approach and this time passed everything in time. So I think I can approve this, but maybe it would help to trim a bit.",

(Is the Isle of Man a country? Anyway, it may be less familiar to some.) It's also possible to treat the output as a variable, highlighting [[best guess]] as what's required.",
