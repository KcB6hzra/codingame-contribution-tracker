I made sure to make test case 3 and not test case 4 the hard one because I commonly find myself prematurely sending my code so I want to help clashers in that matter. This new version will no longer allow a brute force recursive method, it requires memoization (forgive me if I'm misusing that I don't study CS). I think its probably the last change I'd need to make it stick out. Thanks for the feedback!",
