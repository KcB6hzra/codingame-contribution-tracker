Multiplication counts sum up from product to product.\nSo no intermediate nor final result should be over 8E11, that is, far less than 2^63 which was in my mind the limit. \nAnyway, I restricted the bounds for test 4 so it shouldn’t overflow.",

    "content": "Well I know theoretically there could have been an overflow on 32-bit integers, I simply modified my code to keep track of the max intermediate value (which was around 2.10^8 if I remember correctly) to make sure of the following: no overflow occurs on the validators that would not have previously occurred on the tests (I actually don't even care whether an overflow occurs or not, I just don't want it to occur on validators only -- because in that case people sometimes have difficulty understanding why their code is not accepted).\nBut anyway, there is no problem here!\n(That said, as your solution is in JS, 2^63 is probably not a great limit to have in mind as JS numbers are doubles. ;-) )",
