    "content": "I found the instructions and in particular the inter-pool ranking extremely confusing. It literally took me hours to figure out how to read them. In particular, these points:\n\n- Ranking in their pool (Leader, runner-up, third place, last place)\n- Highest number of ranking-points in their pool\n- If equal, best aggregate game-points difference\n\nI read \"highest number of ranking points in their pool\" as \"the highest ranking points of any team in their pool\", or \"the highest RP of any team in that pool in any single game\", or \"the highest total RP of all games in their pool\", all of which make (some) sense. I did NOT understand this as \"THIS TEAM's ranking points in their pool\". IMHO, it's the word \"highest\" that is extremely confusing here and should be removed, and/or replaced with \"their\" (the team's). Similarly for \"best\" in the last point, i.e.\n\n- THEIR ranking in their pool (Leader, runner-up, third place, last place)\n- THEIR number of ranking-points in their pool\n- If equal, THEIR aggregate game-points difference",

    "content": "Some parts that need clarification:\n\n(1) \"1 point if the losing team has lost by a maximum of 7 points.\" Does this mean the losing team scores 1 point if it didn't lose by very much? Or should that say minimum instead of maximum? A larger point difference would be good for the winning team.\n\n(2) Can each team win 2 bonus points total, or 2 bonus points per game?\n\n(3) There are two things called \"points.\" I think one is points scored in a game, and the other is the win/draw/loss/bonus points. Can you use different terminology for these and use it consistently?\n(Also be consistent with \"team\" vs \"club\")\n\n(4) Don't \"ranking in their pool\"  and \"highest number of ranking points in their pool\" mean exactly the same thing? I would expect an inter-pool ranking to compare points across all five pools.\n\n(5) Are the 3 non-leader teams who advance specifically chosen from the 5 second-place teams, and not from all 15 non-leader team?\n\n(6) Needs constraints! It's a lot harder to find the #-# in the middle of a string when the team names can contain digits and '-'. (Maybe change that input to also be comma-separated)",

    "content": "Hi, thanks for your remarks:\n\n1) the defensive bonus point can only be given to the losing team if it has lost by a maximum of 7 points (i'm modify the sentence)\n\n2) \"Each team can have up to 2 bonus points\": i'm adding \"per game\".\n\n3) in a first draft i used \"ranking-points\" and \"game-points\" to clarify, i was afraid it would be \"too much\" but if you think it needs to be clarified i'm putting them back. Also replacing \"club\" by \"team\"\n\n4) \"Ranking in the pool\" mean #1, #2, #3 or #4 ; \"highest number of ranking points\" is the sum of victory/draw/loss + bonus. It means that if team X is the leader of pool A with 20 points, and team Y is runner-up of pool B with 21 points ; team X will be best \"inter-pool\" ranked than team Y. I'm adding precision with parenthesis but if you think of a better way to explain it you can share it\n\n5) In the first paragraph i precised that #6 #7 and #8 are the best runners-up; do you want me to change the term \"runners-up\" to \"second place\"?\n\n6) Can you suggest a \"game-line\" format? What about for example:\nTEAM_A,GAME_POINTS_A,TRIES_A,TEAM_B,GAME_POINTS_B,TRIES_B\n\nThanks again",
