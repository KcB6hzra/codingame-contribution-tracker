    "content": "I agree. It's too much in its current state, ESPECIALLY for reverse mode. That said, I think it could work with a few tweaks. My recommendations:\n\n- Remove reverse mode.\n- Explicitly mention that non-alphanumeric characters are stripped from the input before encoding and that the output is converted to uppercase.\n- Better yet, don't include punctuation in the plain text messages, or include them in the encrypted output.\n- Add another test between 1 and 2 that requires padding the end of the message with the beginning. With something as involved as this CoC, more tests are always good.\n- Minor suggestion: separate the key into two numbers (the size of the blocks and the switching of characters). It gives more emphasis to the size of the block.",
