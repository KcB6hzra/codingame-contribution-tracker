Although you can argue that it can be done with just an array and a few loops, using a dictionary and two passes through the data is most likely the appropriate approach.  This is certainly harder than \"The Descent\" and \"monday tuesday happy days\"\n\nMy rules of thumb for difficulty is as follows : \n* if/else and possibly a loop is 'easy'.  \n* Recursion, DFS, BFS, Minimax is 'medium'.  \n* Tricky or mathy stuff with multiple steps is 'hard' or 'very hard'",
