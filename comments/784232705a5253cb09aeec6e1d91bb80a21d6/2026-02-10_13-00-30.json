For example, rowCount and columnCount are always 32? If so, maybe this part isn't needed at all?\n\nA better idea to me is to turn all those \"variables\" into true variables, i.e. rowCount and columnCount may be unequal, rowCount and columnCount aren't necessarily 32, and/or the positions of the goalCell vary from game to game.\n\n* Please change \"Lines 4 through (goalCellCount + 4)\" to \"Next goalCellCount lines\".\n\n* Please format the variables. See example here: https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/git-patchwork and the corresponding html files here: https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=104932101460256\n\nGame Loop Input\n* Please change \"Lines 1 through rowCount\" to \"rowCount lines\".\n\n* Please change \"ints\"  to \"integers\".\n\n* Please format -1, 1 and 0 as constants.\n\n* Please format the variables.\n\nOutput\n* Please format 1 and 0 as constants.\n\n* Please format the variables.\n\n* \"This represents the left-most column of cells from top to bottom.\": Should it be left-most column for Player 1 and right-most column for Player 2?\n\nConstraints\n* I'm not sure about what you mean by the first constraint. If the constraint is already covered by the input description, the constraint may be deleted.\n\nReferee\n* I haven't studied the referee code so I'm not sure how it handles incorrect input from players. For example, if I output some invalid input for the first turn, the viewer shows that both get 1st place, and the console is silent about the invalid output (i.e. no error messages).\n\nSuggest to update the referee. Also suggest to add sections on Victory Conditions and Defeat Conditions (see example with linked file stated earlier), and mention what happens when a player outputs something invalid or times out (will the player fail to output always lose? or will the player who gets more points always win even if they're the one who fail to output?).\n\nThanks.",
