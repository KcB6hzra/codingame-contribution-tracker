    "content": "In PHP, escape the \" in the initial code  eg. /\".  Instead of Program pointer out of code area at (21/0),  How about \"Program Terminated\" for an E, and \"Program Aborted at (step): Invalid Operation\" for an operation not an OPCODE instead of ignoring them (unless your intention was to let us leave comments on traces).  I'm finding this very challenging.  Especially not given the initial length of n and not having any registers (except for stack indexes).  There's multiple problems inside this problem, it's kinda making me crazy.  I'll bet I'll find more challenges as I delve deeper.  I'll leave it up to others to approve.  I think I could get a sqrt function working to limit the # of divisors, but the whole hanoi tower kinda thing is throwing me without at least 1 register.  Maybe my initial confusion(s) can be rectified easily with more example code.  This fails for test1, but I didn't wanna give it away:  echo(\"\\\"EMIRP\\\"CCCCCE\\n\");",
