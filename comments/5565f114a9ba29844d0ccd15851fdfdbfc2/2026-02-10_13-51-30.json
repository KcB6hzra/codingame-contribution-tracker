    "content": "There can't be a perfect prime in the tests. (see Arglanir's question)\n\nCould you be more specific as to what you changed?\n\nWhy this makes me uneasy:\n- in the musical literature, the distinction is made between a perfect unison (A to A) and an augmented prime (A to A+).\n- so in literature, perfect prime doesn't exist\n- in this puzzle, there can be no perfect unison, only augmented primes\n- so naming natural interval A to A a perfect prime makes sense in neither.\n\nBut it would be even more confusing to include the semantically correct perfect unison in the list instead, since those are out of bounds to the puzzle.\n\nSo best to not include it at all IMHO (the \"prime\" name is in the list, and it's covered in the tests if there's really a need)",
