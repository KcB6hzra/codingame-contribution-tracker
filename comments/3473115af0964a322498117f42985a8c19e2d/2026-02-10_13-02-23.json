    "content": "Alright, I finally finished it and here's the promised upvote :thumbsup:\n\nOne thing, I basically adapted the algorithm of the wiki and currently, after fixing the root, if you don't sort the children nodes you can pass every validator (although not every test, you fail test 4 and 7), so you could technically have 100% in the puzzle while not passing the tests which imo is an issue. So I'll suggest to add a validator (could just be a slight variation of either test 4 or 7 where you have to do the sorting). For example in 4, if I don't sort I will output:\n(1 (3) (2 (5) (4 (7) (6 (9) (8 (10) (11))))))\nyet the correct answer is:\n(1 (2 (4 (6 (8 (10) (11)) (9)) (7)) (5)) (3))\n\ntldr:\n \"2. same level nodes follows the order from small to large.\" is not actually tested in the validators\n\nIf you find time to fix it I'll gladly approve the puzzle.",
