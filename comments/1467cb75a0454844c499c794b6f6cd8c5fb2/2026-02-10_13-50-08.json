Although the working of gears is pretty intuitive, I think a few explanatory lines would be appreciated:\n\n- two gears in contact rotate in opposite directions\n- if two gears moving in same direction come into contact, the entire system can't move\n- this is probably very redundant, but \"two gears are in contact when the two circles defining the gears touch each other i.e. distance between centres = sum of radii\"",

I mean, it makes perfect senses for two gears to roll around the same axis, it happens a lot in actual mechanics.\n\nIt's a problem when they have the same radius, because then we'd have to take a decision on whether or not they touch, and (probably) decide that even though they touch they're not turning in opposite directions. That makes it an ugly exception.\n\nSo yes, eliminating overlap does fix it, but it could be a bit overkill ^^",

If we would allow multiple gears on the same axis then we need to take height (and width) of the gears into account to determine if they mesh. Following the idea that it is just gears on a plane, it makes sense that they don't overlap.\n\nIt could be a good start for another puzzle though. :)",
