    "content": "Thank you!\n\nThe two bits restriction is intended to enforce solution unicity, or there's no proper way to implement the puzzle in a given input/expected output the CG way. I hope I didn't mess it up.\n\nI'm rather biased against more hinting about expected size than the test titles. I'll think it over. (But I kind of cruelly like the beginners complaining it's too hard on the forum :-> )",
