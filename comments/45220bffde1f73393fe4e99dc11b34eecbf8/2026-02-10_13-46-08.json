    "content": "Sorry, for some reason I missed this comment! It's not *actually* needed: If the bipartite graph has a unique perfect matching, then the expected (greedy) approach will always work. This approach is pretty natural (I believe it's easy to come up with it even without formalizing the problem too much) BUT it's not trivial to be convinced that it actually always works (given a perfect matching, if all vertices have degree >=2 then all vertices are incident to 1 matched + >=1 non-matched edge, hence simply alternating between matched and non-matched edges we end up in an alternating cycle, which can be swapped to form another perfect matching, contradicting the uniqueness, hence there always is a leaf, etc).\n\nThe idea of the last paragraph was to help people having this idea to be convinced that it will actually pass. Maybe it's too convoluted though...\n\n(Also, if the expected approach was a bipartite matching algorithm, then I would probably have set the difficulty to hard.)",
