Maybe it'll become a puzzle with a viewer and not in text, in order to cope with multiple possible solutions.",

In some cases, it can take over 1 second to solve just 1 of the dozens of puzzles contained in a test case, if I use my code for Killer Sudoku Solver, after slight modifications to adapt to the revised input format here. (And 5 to 6 seconds in a few puzzles. All the times quoted are offline records, not on CG IDE.)\n\nI've rewritten around 90% of the old code, and also copied some ideas from Kakuro Solver. Now I'm able to pass all the tests and validators. And I'm still using Algorithm X. It just shows how unoptimised my old code is :)",

This is definitely a challenging puzzle and I I feel even better about it now knowing we have two different valid solutions, one with backtracking and one without.",
