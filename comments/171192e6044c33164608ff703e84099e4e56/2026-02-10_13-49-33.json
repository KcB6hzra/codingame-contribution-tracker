    "content": "This is a fun clash for shortest, except that you explicitly state that the answer should be rounded to 1 dp, but then all of the tests and validators give answers that need no rounding as since you have integer inputs there is no way to get more than 1 dp in your answer (sum of integer products divided by 2 will always be 1 dp at worst).\n\nFor shortest mode it can be the difference between winning and losing to include \".round(1)\", so it would be nicer if the statement said something like \"all answers should be shown as floats with 1 decimal place\". But this is just nitpicking really, nice clash. :)",
