Are you talking about a O(R-L) approach per query (i.e. O(N^2) solution overall)?\n\nBecause you are expected to find a roughly O(N) (neglecting Q as Q<<N here) approach to pass the last test. The solution below gives two such approaches. But this can actually even be solved in O(Q log Q) (improving the loop on N in the second approach). There are lots of different efficient approaches!\n\nThe naive O(N^2) approach might pass, in a fast language, when optimized by xoring bitstrings (this basically reduces N by a factor 32 or 64) but, well, fair enough as this is more tedious anyway.\n\nEDIT: Last testcase removed. The naive O(N^2) approach will pass from now on.",

I have a hard time believing anyone would come up with an off the cuff  solution that can figure out a way to mark the beginning and end of the flips and sum the final results.\n\nIt was pretty easy to write a solution that stored all the coin positions and flips all them in the range but of course that fails the last test because of timeout. \n\nThen I had to study the given solution for a while to understand how they were able to track all the flips, which the method is way outside the normal solution process for a problem.    So I call B.S. on your idea that this is solved super easily and everyone should get it in a couple of minutes.  I bet you the success rate on this will be under 5% within the 15 minutes, probably even lower than that.",
