    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: Nice addition of multiple iterations. It is a little bit bland, it won't change much but maybe you would consider letting the map sizes and starting positions be different for each map? Also, not quite the same puzzle but maybe consider giving a map (consisting of \".\", \"#\", & \"T\") and then having the different iterations be a set of instructions? Additionally you can add extraneous arrows so that it would force people to count the path length rather than the number of arrows as you suggested. I fear that this would only confuse entry level coders the way you suggest that you can count the number of arrows on that map as it is much easier to count while verifying that the path exists. Overall good job making a relatively unique puzzle.",
