    "content": "Ok, getting there.\n\nPre-solve comments:\n\n* relations seem to be between any two features, including name. So why is the name made special by being reduced to an initial? (when the tests don't even need that)\n\n* I don't see Einstein's actual riddle in the test cases. It should really be there.\n\n* I'd suggest using a clue format that's easy to parse in all languages (i.e., space-separated). For example: \"George - Salad\" and \"George | Salad\"\n\n* it's been a long time, but I recall part of the original riddle was to extract all features from the hints, which is out of the picture here. Is that voluntary? Can we root to get it back?\n\n* I don't think 1*2 is very interesting, and I do think it's a naughty surprise to present as a pendant for 2*1.\n\n* \"an Einstein's riddle\" sounds like a grammatical error, yet it's kinda cute. I'd keep it anyway ^^",

Salad\", but I put a very hard riddle that was too long for the input (no more characters available), so I removed the spaces (to be shorter). But finally, I thought the last one was too hard and I removed it. So now that it can fit the available number of characters, I think I can revert back to \"G ! Salad\" format. \n\n* As for Einstein's real riddle, it's a bit different from what I present here, as there is an actual order of people (G lives in the next house to the right, for example), and I am not sure how this can fit with my format as it is now.\n\n* Well, for the names,... I don't know, it was actually to simplify my inputs (manual input is long) AND to shorten it, but I guess I could do a find/replace now\n\n* Extract all features from the hints? What do you mean exactly? Guess from some sentences the features? Guess all characteristics from the hints without actually describing them?\n\n* I wanted to do a 1 * x or x * 1 test for an obvious test, just as a control sample\n\n* Do you mean we don't put a pronoun before a proper name? English is not my first language... do you really think I should keep it ? ^^\n\nI'll do these changes later, as I am kinda exhausted right now.",

    "content": "Mid-solve comments:\n\n* I've looked up the canonical one online in the meantime. Indeed, it doesn't fit your format. It would actually have much stronger on both parsing and unification. Which could make for a great puzzle as well, but a different (and harder) one.\n\n* for the names, yeah, I think it's more clear for at least the part of them that's used as examples and in the problem statement. You can do whatever makes sense to push the boundaries in the later (say 3rd and on) test cases if you need to squeeze more attributes in there.\n\n* extract features from the hints means mostly \"not have an enumeration of features at all\". But I mostly wrote this with the canonical riddle in mind, I think your puzzle is actually fine in this regard.\n\n* I'm fine with control tests in theory, though in your puzzle's case I think they'd be better spent exploring weirder logic cases (but that's just weak opinion, nothing to act upon per se). What really bugs me is the fact the validation case checks something different to the test case. But your tests do have sensible titles, it might be ok after all.\n\n* The saxon genitive is worth a \"the\" determiner. (so if you wanted an \"a\", you'd hack with something like \"one of Einstein's riddles\"). But there isn't a commonly accepted single noun for this puzzle type, so I think adding an \"an\" elevates it to the rank of common noun in a grammatically incorrect yet humorous way. That I personally find tasteful here. YMMV.\n\nI'm kind of exhausted too. Must be your puzzle :p",
