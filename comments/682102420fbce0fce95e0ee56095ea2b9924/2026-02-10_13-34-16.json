I think the difficulty is appropriate for a CoC. \n\nFor a classic puzzle, one could for sure add the consecutive closing braces and/or adding indentation based on if, else, while etc. keywords (Could be extended to smth like a code beautifier/deminifier). But this could be much fun as a CoC as is.",

In perl it works without \\Z, but other engines? Idk. Probably JS won't like it.",
