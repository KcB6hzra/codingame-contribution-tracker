    "content": "Ok, second great write-up in a row, I'm hereby subscribing to your newsletter.\n\nFeedback:\n\n* you mention \"non self-intersecting\" for the tiles, so this begs the question: \"oh, so they can intersect each other between tiles?\" Ironically, neither would really make the puzzle any more complex, just the pictures.\n\n* I had a pause at the \"seed known => we can regenerate\" that I (think I) wouldn't have if it came after the \"we need to recover N and T\". Pause = trying to figure out how to reverse the RNG to generate edges, when really it's both the wrong approach and off-topic. But I'll concede the text flows pretty well as is, which wouldn't necessarily be the case the other way round.\n\n* I suspect this comes from mixing up the word \"input\"'s context between the map generator and the puzzle. So I'd suggest 1) not using the word input at all in the statement section, and 2) repeating \"N and T\" when that's what's talked about.\n\n* BTW, they're called N and T in the statement, but C and T in I/O.\n\n* a common vertex joins continents, but those in the pictures all share an entire edge.\n\nThis is really my HQ-puzzle feedback game, aiming to minimize false starts. None of it is required to have the contribution accepted.\n\n(Oh, and I don't think this warrants hard either, but I don't think my opinion on puzzle difficulties is worth that much nowadays)",
