The large inputs make binary search pretty much necessary which is nice.\nOne small thing @Diabetos found that sqrt(7*R/8) works for everything except F=1. Might want to add a test with R=1 to block that shortcut, but up to you.",

So if you want you clash to be protected from it, you should add that test, if you don't, that would become a math problem rather than a programming one, I'm not a huge fan of those",

    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: As @ProDige_cheese has pointed out, this clash can be solved without the use of binary search so long as you limit the search range of F appropriately. I used a bit of math to figure out that R ≥ sqrt(F/2) and hence came up with:\n\nr=int(input())\nf=int((r//2)**0.5)\nwhile f*(f+f//7)<r:f+=1\nprint(f)\n\nI would advise against trying to force a binary search solution as that might make this clash too difficult for beginners to solve. That being said, I think the clash is currently in a good state in that sub-optimal solutions are still possible whilst still encouraging optimisation.",

Instead, apply this formatting to all instances of the variable names [[F]] and [[R]] only (both in the formula and elsewhere).\n\n* To avoid giving an unintended hint about using the \"floor\" function for some languages, replace \"floor(x)\" with \"⌊x⌋\". Likewise, use \"⌊F / 7⌋\" and \"⌊1.9⌋\" instead of \"floor(F / 7)\" and \"floor(1.9)\".\n\nCases\n* Please revise the cases so that the input values increase progressively. A suggested structure is:\n\n  • Test 1 and Validator 1: 1-digit input\n  • Test 2 and Validator 2: 3-digit input\n  • Test 3 and Validator 3: 6-digit input\n  • Test 4 and Validator 4: 10-digit input\n  • Test 5 and Validator 5: 13-digit input\n\nYou're encouraged to have more than 4 pairs of cases when necessary.\n\nThanks.",
