    "content": "I really enjoyed solving this problem using Dart. The concept of calculating combinations is always interesting, and the constraints made it manageable and fun. It was a nice exercise in using factorials and understanding how combinations work in practice.\n\nOne suggestion to improve the problem would be to clarify the input/output format a bit more. Also, it would be great to add more examples with edge cases, like when  k=0 or k=n, just to make sure all possibilities are covered. Overall, I had a great time solving it!",
