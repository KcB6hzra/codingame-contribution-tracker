    "content": "Ok, I had to think more than five minutes on how to interpret the statement. My problem was maybe not to read the statement carefully first, because now that I understand how the random string relates to the pegs, I see that it is technically all described in the statement. Somehow the combination of height, random, and then a seed into this random, gave in my head too much options for interpretation.\n\nIs the 'seed' item fundamental to the added complexity? After the six minutes of thinking, I realized the task at hand, and started to plan my coding. I think the coding challenge is especially in using height and the random string to correctly map the pegs, and then to link that to an answer. That would require me another four minutes. The 'seed' does not really add to the coding complexity, while it did cause me some minutes of thinking what it all meant. I would personally prefer to dive heads on into the coding challenge after a quick understanding of the statement, which in my opinion would be better possible without the 'seed' parameter. As for the randomness of the game plinko (for which probably the 'seed' parameter is added), I would say that providing a random string already covers that part of the background story.",
