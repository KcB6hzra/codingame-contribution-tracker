    "content": "Nice contribution !\n\nA few questions on the tests:\n\n1. What is the difference between\n- No place for dot and No place for dot valid\n- Empty smallest grid and Empty smallest grid valid\n- Fragmented object and Fragmented object valid ?\n\nIn all these cases, the first test already represents the test case and has the same number of valid solutions as the 'valid' version.\n\n2. Do you expect any brute force soution to fail in the 'lots of solutions' tests ?\n\nI tried a solution where for each position in the grid I tried to insert the top left corner of my object at that position, that's as brute force as I can imagine it and it still passed.",

Tell me if the new formulation is clear to you.\n- In the statement, it is written \"Flips and rotations are NOT allowed on the object.\". I think it's clear enough. Did you miss that sentence? Or do you suggest something else?\n- I asked to output grid state for two reasons:\n  * I find it fun to draw the solution. I think it's not fun to just compute the number of solutions.\n  * Drawing the solution should help beginners to find whatever is going wrong with their code.\n- Ok, I let the difficulty to easy.",

    "content": "Hi Esadruhn,\n\n1. It is a requirement for tests and validators to work by pairs.\nA validator should be similar (but different) than the test it is associated too. [https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/defining-test-cases]\n\"No place for dot\" tests the case of a full grid without empty spaces.\n\"Empty smallest grid\" tests the case of an empty grid and a piece of the same dimension of the grid.\n\"Fragmented object\" tests an object which parts are not connected to each other.\n\n2. No, I don't expect brute force solution to fail for the last test. As you can observe, my python3 code is brute force actually and I'm not aware of a clever way to solve this puzzle.\nI just expect the player to feel satisfied by passing the last test which has a lot of solutions.",
