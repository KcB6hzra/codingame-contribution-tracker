I think the obscure characters in the test cases aren't necessary and hopefully don't disadvantage certain languages.\nAlso I would put \"i.e. each line of output should start with the same name as the corresponding line of input.\" in <<bold>> just to make that part very clear (I thought that was the hardest part of the problem).",

    "content": "I found it difficult to understand what \"in the same order as input\" meant for the output. It was never clarified that rules could be out of order and that made it difficult to problem solve as the only time that came into account was in the long name test and afterwards. This made it nearly impossible to debug as I could never read a single line of input on one screen, I would constantly need to scroll back and forth. I'd be happy to approve this, but the statement needs to be more clear. And more succinct tests. Usually subsequent tests only add one extra level of complexity, but several of yours add multiple at once, making it difficult to discern why a test might fail.",

    "content": "> \"It was never clarified that rules could be out of order\"\n\nWhat exactly do you mean by this? That you expected the rule for person X be adjecant to the rule for whomever X is passing the ball to? The fact that the first 2 test cases have that order is an unfortunate side effect of having test cases with N <= 3. \n\nI added a clarification to the output section. Do you have any better recommendation on how to specify more clearly that each line of output should start with the same name as the corresponding line in the input?\n\n> \"subsequent tests only add one extra level of complexity\"\n\nI agree that this should be the case. I added more cases and ordered them with increasing complexity. I also Increased the first (Example) test case from 3 to 4 to make it obvious that neither input or output are sorted in any manner.",
