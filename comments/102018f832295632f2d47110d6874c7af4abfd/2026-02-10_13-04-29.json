    "content": "Hi !\n\nNice problem, one little thing that might help some people would be to add a little note for C++/C, etc... developers to use a big int type, like unsigned long long.\nBut maybe this is part of the problem, and the users have to search 20! to realize that it is to big for a simple int. I don't really know.\n\nThank you for the problem !",
