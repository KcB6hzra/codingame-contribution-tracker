I looked up the number (apparently it's called the \"Avogadro constant\" which was 6.022*10^23) and the use of commas makes the number appear to be 6023.1^23 because of the way the comma differs from how numbers are written in English (with the decimal point using the period and the thousand break being a comma). As it is, I think the number should be written as either 6.023×10^23 (which is also how it is on wikipedia) or shorthand science notation as 6.023e23.",

What I'm targetting right now is that it's marked for reverse mode, and with all reverse proposals I try to solve the problem without looking at the description, since this is what users are expected to do in a real clash fight.\n\nWhat strikes me as a bit confusing is that when the description is not there this appears as a chameleon problem - I'm getting the impression that I was required to convert the format into a new value (since there exists a unit). After a bit of tinkering with my code I managed to fix my bug of treating all letters as independent and it does work (so it id have a simple solution and was not what I was assuming - that a more difficult formula was in place). So here are some new notes:\n\n1. The output format having a unit was mildly confusing, for inputs which had implied units of unknown form.\n2. Validator 3's expected output has a trailing 0, which is not tested for in sample test cases. You need more tests or for that to be swapped into a visible test, otherwise it is impossible to account for when that's not met yet and the sample tests still pass.\n3. This is just a nitpick at this point and I don't really mind if it's not changed but it might be more straightforward to put the formula line (CO2) above all else to distinguish it from the catalogue. Like this:\nCO2\n2\nC 12.011\nO 15.999",
