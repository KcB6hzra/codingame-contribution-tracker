    "content": "Hi, just came from a reverse clash and this was hard. Now looking at the statement I feel like I should have seen that none of the input numbers are in the output.\nThere were 3 things I was (too) focused about while doing this:\n* Input and output have the same length. If there was a case where this wasn't a possibility, it might help (like `911` -> `2000`)\n* The second+ digit is always the first%2 for all test cases except 9: `82222` but still all digits were even. I thought this was a major part of the statement\n* The first digit is always 1 more then the first digit of the input. Except for `56` -> `70` which just happend to map a multiple of 7 (and 14) to another one. This one is mostly on me though.\n\nIn the end i went with something that worked for 8/10 of the test cases (the 2 above mentioned not)\nLink to clash: https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/579e8731c9868f98614ed6d60ea275f1ba7",
