The statement is clearly written, and the graphics cover everything necessary.\n\nI used a combination of heuristics and recursive backtracking; no pathfinding was required. C++ managed to brute-force the solution, but I wasn’t as lucky when trying to brute-force it in Kotlin.\nSome non-blocking recommendations:\n\n1. Each testcase should have exactly one matching validator, whether by flipping, mirroring, or rotating the board. Yours are a bit random. I failed some validators in both parts while passing all testcases, which can be a bit discouraging.\n\n2. I would probably highlight only a single cell in case of hitting an intersection.",

In either case, could you clarify the scenarios you're considering?\n\nRules\n* Please specify the location of the origin (0, 0), and indicate the directions which the x- and y-coordinates increase.\n\nLoss Conditions\n* Consider reordering the points to match the order in which the loss conditions are checked: \"Response…\", \"The…\", \"Attempted…\" and \"Number…\".\n\nOutput\n* Please change the heading to \"Output per turn\".\n\n* Please change \"first coordinate\" to \"first tile\".\n\n* Please change \"second coordinate\" to \"second tile\".\n\n* Please state that each section of the path must be strictly horizontal or vertical.\n\n  (i.e. either [[x1]] = [[x2]] or [[y1]] = [[y2]])\n\nYour question 1\n* Unsure on the limits for turns / time limits: Have you tested your solution to verify that it's possible to solve all cases within the current time limits? This should serve as the initial basis. We'll also need feedback from other CodinGamers to determine whether the limits feel too loose, just right, or too tight.\n\nExample\n* Please add \"3 3\" as the first line of the input.\n\n* (optional) You could embed an image (e.g. of a grid showing the coordinates and the solution) here if it helps illustrate the example.\n\nDefault stub\n* The order of the variables in the default output line differs from the one stated in Output section.\n\nError messages\n* \"Invalid colour identifier number\": Consider deleting the word \"number\" for consistency with Output section.\n\n* \"Same input or not straight line\": Would it be more precise to say \"point\" instead of \"input\"?\n\nViewer\n* One path segment was missing in the viewer after I passed the case \"Around the World\": https://imgur.com/a/9HqUz81 . Here's the solution I used:\n\nh, w = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\nfor i in range(h):\n    row = input()\nsolution = \"\"\"1 0 0 0 1\n1 2 2 2 2\n0 0 0 3 1\n3 0 3 3 1\n0 3 3 3 1\n1 0 1 1 1\n2 0 2 1 1\n3 0 2 0 1\"\"\".splitlines()\nfor line in solution:\n    print(line)\n\nCases\n* Look good, except that the \"Large\" cases aren't really that large? I'll probably examine the cases more closely later.\n\nThanks.\n\nP.S. Yay, I found the Easter egg too! 🤣",

    "content": "Thanks 😇 Many points to brush up on! \n\nKey responses:\n\n* Question 1 time - I've done in java and python and both work fine with current time restraints - I've not tested to find the actual execution time of them but was more a general question due to other languages - My understanding is there is a variable time limit for different languages in regular puzzles - so wondering how I work out a good rule for setting a single time limit for all.\n\n* Question 1 turn limit - Technically with the tight loss conditions not allowing \"invalid paths\" the turn limit is h*w - (no. of start_tiles / 2) - The only thing that will change that if allowing for creation of the same path/link multiple times or allow for changing the colour of links/paths. I guess the question refers to Q2 also about allowing invalid moves or removing mention of turn limit as it can't be reached / setting it to a variable based on the equation above.\nedit: Alternatively I could set the limit to be h*w -  (no. of start_tiles / 2) - 1 which would force the user to have at least 1 path connecting more than 2 tiles.\n\n* Question 2 - I mean in terms of visuals - adding a connector even if the output is invalid (e.g. connecting wrong colour to a 'start node' or crossing over) Suppose it would help with debugging but is also a bit ugly - https://imgur.com/a/BB2i0mR\n\n* Viewer - That wasn't actually visual, that was a bug in the end game function thinking those were connected... Should be fixed now.\n\n* Cases - Originally were 7x7, which isn't large but computationally is a lot larger but I decided that 6x6 is probably a good limit. I could/will test dense 7x7s to see how bad they actually are though.\n\n* Error messages and case names were just testing/low effort - Just wanted to get the puzzle out there for others to test / comment on 😃\n\nHope you enjoyed finding the egg 😂\nThanks for your comments, as always!",

Nothing changes on your end except test cases:\n\nPart I - Medium - backtracking\nPart II - Hard - backtracking + significant optimization\n\nI really like the visuals you get by making this a solo game. The downside is that all languages get the same time limit.

In both cases, no new rules have been introduced. However, the algorithm used to solve the easier version will not solve the harder version. How about Mars Lander 2 vs 3?\n\nI'm kind of a fan of the multi-step puzzle family.

    "content": "Nonogram: did you mean Codewars instead of CG?\n\nIn CG, the maximum number of test cases for puzzles without a viewer is 25 pairs. I believe it's even higher for viewer-enabled puzzles? In both types of puzzles, it's entirely possible to include cases of increasing difficulty within a single puzzle, without needing to split it into multiple parts when the rules stay the same.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, \"Rummikub\" is a great example. Its split into two parts is justified by the shear number of test cases, which wouldn't fit into a single puzzle. It's also thoughtfully designed, gradually introducing new rules and scenarios. This aligns well with your idea of a \"multi-step\" puzzle: something that can absolutely be achieved within a single puzzle when done well.\n\nWith that in mind, I don't really see why \"Takuzu Solver\" needs to be in 2 parts, or why \"Mars Lander\" parts 2 and 3 are separate. The same goes for \"The hungry duck\": the author claims that players don't have to care about timeouts in part 1 while they do in part 2, but I was able to solve both with the same solution.\n\nThat said, it's perfectly ok for us to have different views on this 😉. I'm also glad to hear that you like the tunnels idea. If that (or other rule variations) is introduced in part 2, I'd fully support splitting \"Connect the Colours\" into two parts.",

In my head it's a 50/50 whether it effects it or not.\n\n* My search is SENW which passes but failed the new 3 with any other search order...\n** I've now added extra optimizations on top of the standard brute-force code I had and now all pass (only tested the 3 new tests) regardless of directions but some search orders were slower. That being said, that is using the same directions regardless of the situation, you could change it and give prioritiy to directions pathing closer to the other colour tile which probably would be better anyway.\n*** Naturally with this type of problem I think the order will matter anyways, if we're dealing with a colour tile near the bottom left and the other is top right SWNE will be slower finding a solution than NESW (assuming dfs)\n\n@Timinator\nRegarding the larger tests - I just make them manually by filling a ?x? square and removing the middle bits... The issue may be that since there are only 9 colours a 9x9 and 10x10 will have a fair few empty tiles but I'll make some anyways and see the outcome...

My point is that a player shouldn't have to rely on one specific search order to succeed in all cases. For instance, why should SENW be the \"winning\" order rather than any other? That feels arbitrary and illogical. If a solution works with SENW, it should also work with NWSE, or any other order. If it doesn't, that could be a sign of unintended bias in the case design. I'd be surprised if the original Numberlink puzzle favoured any particular search order. If it does, someone ought to publish a research paper on it! 😆\n\nBy the way, I've found this link which details how one website designs their Numberlink puzzles: https://puzzlemadness.co.uk/howwemakenumberlink/",

My personal view is that the time limit should be based on the execution time of the most commonly used \"slower\" languages on the platform (Python and PHP, I guess?), with a small buffer added.\n\nWhat are the longest execution times (after reading the inputs) you've seen for your Python and Java solutions so far?\n\nQuestion on turn limit\n* I can't see the point of forcing the player to have at least 1 path longer than 2 tiles.\n\nIn effect, the maximum number of turns is always h * w - (no. of start_tiles / 2), since it's impossible not to exceed that without triggering an error. So, it seems reasonable to just define that as the general upper bound, which you've set as 50 (and that fits particularly well if you plan to have 7x7 cases).\n\nQuestion on viewer behaviour for invalid path\n* I think it's clearer if the viewer shows an invalid path when applicable.

It looks clear and well done!\n\nConstraints\n* Consider changing \"turn outputs\" to \"subsequent outputs\" for clarity.\n\n* It may be a good idea to specify as a constraint the range of number of colours in the cases.\n\nCases\n* A few cases are designated as both a test and a validator. Apart from \"All Colours Test\" 1 and 2 where this dual designation can be easily justified, are the other designations likely to change?\n\nThanks.",
