Given that it was the creator's aim to create an easy clash for beginners, descriptions & cases are clear and it is certainly doable in 5 minutes (python 20 seconds), this clash checks the boxes.",

    "content": "It is a nice clash, but maybe a bit easy.\n\nIn comparison to your Javascript Solution, my solution is in Python.\n\n```\nstring = input()\nprint(string.swapcase()[::-1])\n```\n\nThe idea is simple, which is good and all, I am just stating it for how I see it.\n\n\nConstraints:\n*Please add a constraint specifying the maximum length of the input [[string]]. Example below:\n```\n0 < length of [[string]] <= max length\n```\n\nOther than that, good clash.\nWell suited to all three modes and clear statements and test-cases.\n\nPlease add the constraint, and I will consider promoting my upvote into an approval.\nIf @5DN1L has any other advice, please follow it closely.\n\nThanks and happy coding!\nCode-Parser",

I do understand that this clash is possibly a bit too easy.\n\nMy main goal was to create a simple clash for beginners.\n\nPeople who chose to solve clashes in Python will have an advantage in most situations.
