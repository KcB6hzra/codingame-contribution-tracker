    "content": "This could be an interesting problem, but it's currently very under-defined.\n\nOn the topic of graphing, some considerations come to mind:\n- How big (height x width) does the figure need to be? Does it vary between graphs, and how so?\n- (related) When plotting the next character to the right, what is the change in x value? Similarly, when plotting the next character above, what is the change in y value?\n- Is there a threshold value for considering gradients as \"steep\"? The puzzle might not work well if this is purely visual, as it leaves the plotting function wide open for interpretation.\n\nOn the topic of ASCII art:\n- Are there any rules for which column to use when switching between line types? E.g., I see that a \"\\\" character must be placed directly below a \"|\" character on the graph, while a \"/\" character must be placed to the left of (and below) the same \"|\" character. Is this a standardised rule?\n\nOn the mathematical functions, not all languages will have an eval-like function, which might make calculating difficult:\n- Do you only expect players to graph (regular) polynomial functions? If so, what are the range of powers that you will provide? How about coefficients?\n- Do you expect players to calculate gradients? Do you expect players to implement a numerical method to do so? What is the margin of tolerable error?\n- Please provide some description of how mathematical expressions (in line 1) will look like in your input description. E.g., \"The formula takes the form of [[cN]]{{x**}}[[N]] {{+}} [[cN-1]]{{x**}}[[(N-1)]] {{+}} ... {{+}} [[c1]]{{x}} {{+}} [[c0]], where [[c0]], [[c1]], ..., [[cN-1]], [[cN]] are in range <specify range>. If any of [[c0]], [[c1]], ... are 0, the corresponding term is not displayed.\"",
