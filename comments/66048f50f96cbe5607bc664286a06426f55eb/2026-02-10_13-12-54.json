    "content": "I'll answer your question 2 first. I'll need some time to digest the comments in relation to question 1.\n\n(a) There were a few times when the forum bot CommunityBot failed to automatically create a new discussion *thread* and I manually created one for each of them without bothering CG staff. So, if you want, you may copy the format from the other CommunityBot posts and start a new discussion thread yourself, or I can do it for you if you want to.\n\n(b) I've already got an incomplete list of puzzles where the discussion *tab* is missing from the puzzle pages. (It's an evergrowing list as well because I keep updating it when I become aware of a new puzzle which exhibits that issue.) I would have requested CG staff to fix that, but the new guy who replaced the ex-Community Manager now *never* replies to my PMs on Discord regarding the requests I made almost half a year ago (and he still replied to me a few times back then), and I won't raise any new requests until the earlier ones have been addressed. So, you may either raise a bug for your particular puzzle in the bug channel on Discord, or wait for me to raise a request to fix all the affected puzzles (*if* that happens, that is)...\n\n(c) I suspect that non-ASCII characters in the title may have caused the issue for CommunityBot. I've just found that the same thing happened to the puzzle \"🃏 FreeCell 🃏\": https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-freecell/188909",

I think adding a hint in the statement as per CarlWalsh's comment is the way to address the issue for now.\n\nPatrickMcGinnisII's comment\n* Seems to be the same issue raised by TBali?
