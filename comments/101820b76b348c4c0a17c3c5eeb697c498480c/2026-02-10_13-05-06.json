If not, print {{Invalid}}.\nIf [[n]] is 0, print {{None}}.\n\nInput\n* Please change \"Following lines\" to \"Next [[n]] lines\".\n\nOutput\n* Please add \"or {{Invalid}} or {{None}}.\n\nConstraints\n* Please change \"N\" to \"n\" for consistency.\n\n* Please change the upper bound to 100 because [[n]] does not exceed 100 in all the cases.\n\nCases\n* Except for the n=0 case, please change each pair of test and validator so that they are similar but not the same.\n\nStub generator\n* Please add a write statement, e.g. \"write answer\".\n\nThanks.",

So it's not a critical issue that this code would fail on that hypothetical corner case.\n\nNote: the error would be \"IndexError: list index out of range\" and the code would not output anything, so it's not that the code would be incorrect either, it just fails to output.\n\nWell spotted though.",
