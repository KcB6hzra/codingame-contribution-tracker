Easy: swap test and validator. But then many are going to wonder why they can't solve test 3.\n\nI'd suggest either adding explicit int64 cases, or trimming down all cases to \"int32- compatible\", with adjusted constraints.",

I mean, is flower spots are squeare shaped, and we shouldn't use it if flower bed boundary crosses the square? Or flower is a point and we can plant it if the point inside a flower bad? Or even flowers are circles and we souldn't use spots when flower bed boundary crosses the circle?",

    "content": "Nice problem, very well set! Feedback:\n\n* \"very hard\" seems a bit much: it's two google searches away to deduce a smart solution (say medium), or feasible with an O(N*min(deltaX,deltaY)) scanning one (medium-hard).\n\n* we've had this debate recently on another puzzle: \"counter-clockwise\" isn't directly meaningful if there isn't a centroid from which all vertex progression can be seen as in the same direction (in a word, a convex poloygon). I understand why you put that information in, but I fear it conveys a wrong idea when all it helps with is skipping an abs operation. I'm not sure I have a \"great\" improvement suggestion here :(\n\n* I've re-read 3 times and I still haven't convinced myself that the obvious \"it's all on the standard integral orthonormal lattice\" follows from the statement. It's kind of ok if it doesn't, the test cases are there, but it's more highly classy if it does.\n\n* I think part of the confusion comes from your strings reifying the grid (IIUC), while a possibly more natural interpretation of \"hammering poles and stretching strings\" would be to mark the perimeter. Especially when that's the one shown in the diagrams.\n\nStill, great job, very fine work with the diagrams!",

    "content": "When you get more experience in problem solving, you will start thinking about problems differently.\nFor example, a common trick with _counting_ problems is to count or compute something else (which is easier to count or compute) and that may be related, and then search for a relation.\nIn this case an obvious candidate is the area, so you may want to search for a relation between the number of points inside a polygon and its area. If this does not ring a bell, remember that google is your friend!.\n\nNote: this approach works as well for my other submission (\"The lost files\")",
