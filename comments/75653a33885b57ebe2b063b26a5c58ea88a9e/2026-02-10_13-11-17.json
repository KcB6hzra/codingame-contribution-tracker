    "content": "Except the underlying constraint is that there is always exactly one odd number and zero or more even numbers in the input, so I do not wish to add any test with multiple odd numbers (or none).\n\nReverse is a speed contest, and having acting on a more complex interpretation of the puzzle lose you the puzzle because you didn't observe enough and missed the simpler interpretation is actually a very interesting outcome I didn't foresee. It encourages you to aim at simpler interpretations, keeping it simple, which is a really useful skill in real life. :-)",
