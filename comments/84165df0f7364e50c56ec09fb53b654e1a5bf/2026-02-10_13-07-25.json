Due to the \"monstrous\" examples, this is not possible I think that medium is indeed the better classification.\n\nMany languages require you to change the number format once the numbers approach 20 digits, so it might be nice to have an example with around 15 digits that can still be solved. As an alternative, some puzzles with huge solutions require you to print the solution modulo some reasonably large number, e.g. the prime 10^9+7. In your example, you might also just ask for the last 9 digits.",

And probably the C guys will want to know if they can factorial without overflowing (although this is more delicate, since you will be somehow giving a potential hint).\n\nI think it's a medium yes. The optimization required to pass the last testcases is not trivial at all (imo).",
