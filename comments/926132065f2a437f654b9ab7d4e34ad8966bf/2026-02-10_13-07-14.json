I also used RegEx and recursion, which meant I could solve it in about 6 lines of code. I think that most clashers would struggle even harder on this one, but I do like it a lot. :)",

    "content": "Goal\n* Paragraph 1: Please format all instances of \"+\" and \"|\" as {{constants}}.\n\n* Please delete the example. An example has already been shown in Example section.\n\nInput\n* Suggest to delete \"as a mathematical formula\".\n\n* Please format \"k\" and \"M\" as {{constants}}.\n\n* Please delete the example. An example has already been shown in Example section.\n\nSolution code\n* I haven't checked your code in detail, but it seems that you perform a rounding every time when you call the `calculate_parallel` function. It can give a different result if the rounding is peformed only once at the end.\n\nLuckily that doesn't seem to affect the output for your cases, but I've tried this case:\n1M + (7k | 11k) + 100 + (17k | 13k)\nThe result is 1011745 if I use your code but 1011744 if I round the result at the end only.\n\nThe statement should clearly specify **When** rounding should be performed. Rounding at the end only (i.e. no rounding in any intermediate calculation steps) makes more sense to me.\n\nOutput\n* What do you mean by \"rounding up or down depends on the descendants\"? Please be clear. I think writing \"Total resistance rounded to the nearest integer\" is sufficient.\n\nConstraints\n* Please format \"+\" and \"|\" as {{constants}}.\n\n* Please add: \"All individual values in [[formula]] are positive integers.\"\n\nThanks.",
