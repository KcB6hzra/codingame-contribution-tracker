    "content": "It's a good idea. I would advise you to change the first test case however, as it seems that it does matter in which order the numbers are returned, i.e. lower -> upper -> numbers -> special. Using 1111 as the first test doesn't convey this order, because there's an equal number of each. Validator 3 would be a good first example as you can clearly see in which order it needs to be returned, without it being too obvious.",

    "content": "This is a fun idea, but it's close to impossible in its current form.\n\nYou need at least 2 more easy test cases for this to be feasible (i.e. max of 4 characters each), though because of the complexity of the problem, I would actually go for 4 extra cases.\n\nTo solve this puzzle, you have to figure out:\n(1) the sequence of characters does not matter (a critical clue),\n(2) there are four types of characters\n(3) when a character type is missing from the input, the output is treated differently,\n(4) the order of the output\n(5) how to treat spaces\n\nSome of these are not properly addressed in the current test case suite (especially #1). Besides, 5 test cases to figure out 5 things at once (maybe even more) is unreasonable for the time limit of a CoC.",
