    "content": "First: From your statement, the numerator can be 9^9, the denominator can be equal to it and can't be 9^9 on its own, which might be a typo or a flaw in your statement.\n\nFrom your Statement, a fraction with 0 as denominator could be given (both numerator and denominator would be 0). From a programming perspective, it still works, however that can't happen in math. \n\nI don't really see why numerator has to be smaller or equal to the denominator. If you state that 0 <= numerator <= 9^9 and 0 < denominator <= 9^9, personally that feels better to me. \n\nI think it would be interesting to add some negative numbers as well, forcing clashers  without gdc to use the Euclidean algorithm (with division, not substraction) over some bruteforce for loops. \n\nOverall, I like the contribution and will most likely Approve it.",
