Approving.\n\nComments:\n\n- This feels like  the community puzzle I've had to write the most code for.\n\n- I'm glad I'm over this :D The problem is interesting, but there are so many moving parts it makes debugging very inconvenient. I suppose the detailed test cases will help a lot in this regard, but I didn't have them when I was developing :)\n\n- I'm not sure having a different input format for both door placement (NESW) and arrow (^>v<) adds anything. As far as my code's concerned, it's just one more conversion. (if you intend to change this, my preference is on NESW)\n\n- Not sure whether or not it happens in the test cases since in the end my code was robust wrt that, but I did wonder for some time whether or not arrows could be placed on top of another arrows. Possible impacts: internal datastructures, and ambiguity wrt the \"3 live arrows per player\" rule.\n\n- Bug: constraints say doors <= 4 and turns >= 10, I think those are wrong in a few case samples.\n\nThanks for the turn ordering, I do think that makes it a lot clearer.",
