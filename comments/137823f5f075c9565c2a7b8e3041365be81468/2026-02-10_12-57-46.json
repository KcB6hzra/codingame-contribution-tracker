    "content": "Goal\n* Please use \"Print\" instead of \"Return\".\n\n* The instruction \"If a digit is on both diagonals, count it only once.\" is ambiguous. It can be read as \"if a digit *value* appears on both diagonals, don't count it twice (e.g. an 8 in the top-left corner and another 8 in the top-right corner)\", rather than the intended meaning: \"if a *cell* lies on both diagonals, don't count it twice\".\n\nFor example, if the input consists of an n x n square filled with the digit 1 (where n is odd), one could reasonably compute the answer as 1 instead of 2n - 1.\n\nConsider rewording the final sentence as follows:\nIf the diagonals overlap where a digit lies (which occurs only in an odd-sized square), count that digit only once.\n\nConstraints\n* Please change 100 to 10 as [[n]] is never greater than 10.\n\n* Please format \"0\" and \"9\" as {{constants}} and remove the quotation marks.\n\n* Please delete the last constraint as it's already mentioned in the Input section.\n\nCases\n* Please add a new pair of cases where:\n  • n = 10, and\n  • at least 5 lines in the square begin with different numbers of leading 0s (e.g. one line starts with five 0s, another with a single 0).\n\nThanks.",
