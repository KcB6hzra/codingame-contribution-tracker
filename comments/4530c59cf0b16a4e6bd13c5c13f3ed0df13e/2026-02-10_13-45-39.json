    "content": "Looks fun, and \"very hard\" is no joke at first sight indeed (but maybe I'll revise this after I manage to give it some more time).\n\nMy initial impression is that any solver would just solve it during the first turn and then just ignore further input and proceed to send pre-computed output. Makes having the whole per-turn input a bit pointless. But I'm not familiar with CG's custom puzzles restrictions, would removing per-turn input make it impossible to be animated?\n\nIt seems entirely possible to integrate the first turn input inside the initial input's ascii grid - i.e. U D L R for one-way platforms, H, V for horizontal/vertical, A or O for omni-direction platform, C/T or c/C for car/target (or a/A, b/B, c/C for the three-car version), etc. This does not assign ids to the platforms but the output commands could use coordinates instead of ids. Just mentioning it as an alternative to consider, though I don't mind leaving it as it is too. I guess it would be a somewhat large refactoring.",
