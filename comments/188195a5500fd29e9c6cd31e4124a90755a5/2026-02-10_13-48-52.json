    "content": "This is a really tough clash. The only way to really solve it is to do a brute force solution, then find the pattern manually and then code up a hacky solution (O(1)) using the pattern to skip all the brute force work...\n\nIt's a bit frustrating to have to do so much debugging to find a solution that the statement isn't able to tell you. I just got it in fastest mode and no one solved it. I came 2nd with 16% and lost to a bot who got 33%",

While the O(n) solution is easy to implement (maybe a little too much), the O(1) sound tricky to understand (in only 15 minutes). I'm sure a lot of people will give up with only the basic solution. Maybe giving a hint about the cyclical nature of the sequence will fix that.",

Or is it something CG related?\n\nEdit: I've tested further more and I never got the request timeout again, maybe it was something CG related for that moment",
