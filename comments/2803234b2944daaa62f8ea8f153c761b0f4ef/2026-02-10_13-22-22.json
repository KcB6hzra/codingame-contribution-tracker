You know, you don't always have to write it in the most straight-forward way :wink:\n\n(It will be interesting to adapt the test cases too e.g. a pixelated cartoon face magnifier, but it will be too much work, haha.)\n\nFor example, Goal section may be rewritten like this (and other sections have to be adapted accordingly too):\n\nYou have drawn some pixelated art for your client, and they have asked you to magnify your art so that it becomes double in size. That means, each pixel used or unused (represented by {{#}} and {{.}} respectively) will be magnified as 4 pixels (i.e. height of 2 x width of 2, please refer to the example below). Please write the code to do the magnification for you.\n\nJust a suggestion and you don't have to follow exactly :)",
