    "content": "Not a fan at the moment: i found it very confusing with lots of names, variables, and text...\n- The \"mod((xy)^a,n)\" is not very clear because of the highlighting of the variables (i think sometimes 5dn1l goes a little bit crazy with his suggestions lol)\n- Would be better to have the two ints of the key as two separate ints instead of a string containing the two ints. It makes for a very huge time difference between languages just to get the input (for instance in C i had to strtok the string two times to use atoi two times to get the two ints...). There is no reason to make people waste time on coding to get the input, the input should be given.\n- No need to have both a and b, they both are ints and serve as the second int in the key. There should only be one int a, used in different positions for the mod depending on the purpose \n- The whole block position could be fun but is worded very poorly.\n- \"Be aware each block contains a 2-digit integer from the original message. The position starts at 1\" i still don't get this lol\n\nOverall i couldn't finish this clash and had to see your solution only to realize it was very simple, I think you have to rewrite the thing to make everything clearer and a bit simpler. \n\nGood luck !",

    "content": "Please don't take it the wrong way 5D, I appreciate you and your hard work :) For this clash in particular it's not that much that your suggestions are crazy but the main issue is the statement being complicated and inconsistent in general.\n\nFor OP, hard disagree on your take about clashes: just because you like to swap languages for each clash doesn't mean everyone does it. Some people enjoy using only one language or only use one to challenge themselves, some people don't feel comfortable using some languages etc etc. Please don't force your opinion on how clashes should be done on other people :/\n\nAt the end of the day, while i liked the idea of this clash because it's fun and challenging, i still think it needs more work, but that's just my opinion (hence why i didn't rejected it)",
