You still have to fix that for better readability.\n\nI don't understand what you mean by \"proper way\"?\n\nThere should not be duplicate cases. I think you have sufficient pairs of tests and validators, so you may remove one pair and replace one of the \"5 test\" with one of the removed cases.\n\nI also don't understand what you mean for the reason of constraint of 10^9 on N. Actually the constraint is more like 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, because N refers to the input number only, not the output.",
