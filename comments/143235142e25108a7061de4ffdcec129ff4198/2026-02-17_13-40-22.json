    "content": "Binary output issue\n* According to the contribution guidelines, binary outputs should be avoided for clashes. That's exactly the issue with your clash, as it allows only two possible answers (either \"YES\" or \"NO\"). Please modify the output requirement to allow for more than two possible answers.\n\nFormatting\n* Please study the formatting syntax on this page: https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/statement , and format your statement properly as described in the points below.\n\nGoal\n* Please format \"YES\" and \"NO\" as {{constants}}.\n\nInput\n* Please format \"num\" as a [[variable]].\n\nOutput\n* Please change \"the input number\" to \"[[num]]\".\n\n* Please format \"YES\" and \"NO\" as {{constants}}.\n\nConstraints\n* Please format \"num\" as a [[variable]].\n\n* Please refer to @N3l's comment and fix the constraint and/or the cases.\n\nCases\n* Please refer to @N3l's comment and add new pairs of cases.\n\n* Please note that each test and its validator should cover the same scenario with slightly different inputs. For this reason, the default case names are organised in pairs (Test 1 / Validator 1, Test 2 / Validator 2, etc.). There is no need to renumber them intentionally, and your cases should follow the same pairing structure.\n\nThanks.",
