However for me it takes around 5 mins. Here is my Python solution:\n\na,b,c,d = map(int,input().split())\nm = a*c\nn = a*d+b*c\no = b*d\nans = ''\n\nif m!=0:\n    if m==1:\n        ans += 'x^2 '\n    else:\n        ans += str(m)+'x^2 '\n\nif n!=0:\n    if n==1:\n        ans += 'x'\n    else:\n        if n>0:\n            ans += '+ '+str(n)+'x '\n        else:\n            ans += '- ' + str(abs(n))+'x '\n\nif o!=0:\n    if o>0:\n        ans += '+ '+str(o)\n    else:\n        ans += '- ' + str(abs(o))\n\nprint(ans)\n\n:Note:\n1) I don't think we need the explanation regarding the product in the Goal which seems redundant information since you already mentioned the product. It would save coders time by not reading long description. Honestly I was lost reading that description so I directly jumped to impl after seeing the product.\n\n2) In the Pseudo code we can simply provide a,b,c,d instead of long variable names.",

With the text parsing, accounting for the negatives, the missing \"1\", removing zero terms, there is too much going on. I believe this needs some simplification for CoC or to be a classic puzzle. Great job on the test cases and write up!\n\nI believe \"Coefficient is an integer that cannot be 1 or 0\" is incorrect. Your examples include the coefficient of 1 (x by itself implies coefficient 1).\n\nI think the least fun is the text parsing portion. If the input were \"a b c d\" and they were parsed in the stub It think that would be a great step towards making this reasonable for a clash.",

I can definitely word this better, though, so I will be sure to do that.\n\nI may rework this to remove the text parsing, but I'd like to hear what others think about it before I do so. \n\nIf people think that this is too difficult, I may move this problem to a classic puzzle and create a simplified version for CoC.\n\nThank you for the detailed feedback!",
