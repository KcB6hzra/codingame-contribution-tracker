The other gimmicky name, \"CodinBot\", is interesting enough for the story. Suggest removing \"CodinGame\" or replacing it with another descriptor e.g. bot, game, puzzle…\n\n* Please change \"you new keys\" to \"your new keys\".\n\n* Please change \"two stages\" to \"two parts\", since the subsequent text uses \"Part 1\", \"Part 2\" and \"next part\".\n\n* Please format \"24346\", 65535, 65536, \"0x\", and optionally 16 as {{constants}}.\n\n* Please remove the quotation marks around \"24346\" and \"0x\".\n\n* Third segment: Please delete \"of this value\".\n\n* Please change \"-Last\" to \"-Final\" for consistency.\n\n* Suggest deleting \"Note:\" and keeping only the following sentence.\n\nOutput\n* Please include \"serial key\" in the description.\n\n* Please format the three hyphens in the serial key as {{constants}}.\n\nConstraints\n* Please change \"The input is always a string with no minimum or maximum length, which\" to \"[[username]]\".\n\n* Please add \"English\" before \"letters\".\n\n* \"Digits\" is a better term than \"numbers\" when referring to characters. In addition, since the current test cases contain no digits, you can remove the word entirely.\n\n* Please delete the second \"constraint\", as it describes an output requirement, not an output restriction.\n\nDifficulty\n* Please set the difficulty to \"Easy\" instead of \"Medium\".\n\nCases\n* Are there specific aspects that each pair of cases is focused on? Each test and its corresponding validator should be similar; currently, it's not obvious whether that is so. Unless there's a reason for the current pairings, please swap Validator 1 and Test 2 so that Pair 1 inputs contain no underscores while Pair 2 inputs do.\n\n* Please change Validator 4 so that the third segment doesn't begin with 0.\n\n* Please add a new pair of cases where the second segment isn't 0000.\n\n* Please add a new pair of cases where the first segment begins with 0.\n\n* Will there be any cases where the length of [[username]] is 1? This could be a special case for the third segment calculation as one is required to add the first and last ASCII values.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "General\n* You mentioned that you were meant to put this puzzle as a Work In Progress but submitted it ready for evaluation. Please note that you can switch it back to Work In Progress at any time; there is no restriction on doing so.\n\nCases\n* I'd like to reiterate that each test and its corresponding validator should be similar in terms of purpose, focus or input/output characteristics. With that in mind:\n\n* Please revise Validator 3 so that (a) the third segment doesn't begin with 0 and (b) it is more similar to the \"All Characters\" (test 3). (\"flippyfloppyfloopy\" doesn’t really represent an \"all characters\" case.)\n\n* Please revise Validator 4 to use a one-character input, in line with Test 4.\n\n* Please add a new pair of cases where the first segment begins with 0.\n\nOutput\n* Please include \"serial key\" in the description.\n\n* Please format the three hyphens in the serial key as {{constants}}.\n\nConstraints\n* Please use \"English letters\" instead of just \"letters\", as letters from other languages aren't used in the test cases.\n\n* Please replace \"numbers\" with \"digits\" when referring to characters.\n\n* Please replace \"The input is always a string with no minimum or maximum length, which\" with \"[[username]]\".\n\nReasons:\n(1) CodinGame (CG) doesn't allow empty input, so the minimum has to be 1.\n\n(2) CG also prevents inputs over 10,000 characters, so the maximum length is 10,000.\n\n(3) Very long inputs can cause the second segment to exceed 4 hexadecimal characters, and the statement doesn't explain what to do in such cases. Try [[username]] = \"z\" repeated 6000 times, for example.\n\n(4) Since [[username]] is already defined as a variable name, it should be reused for clarity.\n\nSo, please make the suggested change, and add a separate constraint:\n1 ≤ length of [[username]] ≤ 1000\n\nDifficulty\n* Please set the difficulty to \"Easy\" instead of \"Medium\". \"This being your first puzzle\" isn't a valid reason to mark it as Medium. While I'm not a moderately experienced developer like you, I've completed over 90% of the puzzles on this platform, and based on my experience this puzzle fits the Easy difficulty level.\n\nGoal\n* Please change \"-Last\" to \"-Final\" for consistency, as \"Final Segment\" is used earlier in the text, not \"Last Segment\".\n\n* You mentioned that \"the special names are only made up, so I decided to keep them (since this is the name of the platform after all)\".\n\n\"CodinGame development software\" isn't a made up term; it literally means \"development software\" by or for CodinGame. Also, in case you don't know, CG does have a software called \"CodinGame SDK\" (SDK = Software Development Kit) https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/introduction , which is very similar to the name you've \"made up\". This could cause misunderstanding.\n\nIf you insist on keeping the name, please write a clear note that this is purely fictional, similar to your existing well-written note that the puzzle doesn't encourage piracy.\n\nThanks.",
