But:\n1)There is a mistake on the first line, not FB, but FG.\n2)I'd suggest to write CAR LICENCE PLATE(on the first, line, again), because i firstly thought about smth like porcelain :)\n3)Also I'd mention that when new plate is being generated, numbers change firstly(like previous one was AA-123-BB, the next one will be AA-124-BB), next - last letters, and the last ones change first two letters (I mean, specify the order of changing characters compared to the previous plate)\n4) And, to my mind, you should add an example to give a little bit more \nclearance to your goal.\nBut, anyway definitely upvote!",

    "content": "My first reaction to Stilgart's comment was the usual \"what a whiner!\" (my reaction to nicola was unnorteworthy disagreement)\n\nBut that reminded me of the ground debate: should communities necessarily be harder than clashes?\nShould communities necessarily be hard at all? (for whatever definition of \"hard\")\n\nIMHO, the current system's rigged against anything hard, with major impact on community puzzles. Anything easy gets approved fast or very fast. Anything hard doesn't get approved at all, or bypassing the usual 3-moderator vote.\nAnything in-between stays in limbo, but with more debate.\n\nThe rare people who actually approve the hard problems tend to rail against anything easy.\nThe overwhelming majority of people who approve easy problems don't lift a little finger on hard ones.\n[the vast majority of *people* who moderate anything do so without constructive commenting, let alone editing or improving]\n\nEver since XP got introduced, community/clash authoring could be argued to go by market norms, and they're heavily leaning towards getting trivial problems in. From an authour's viewpoint, they're an enormously better source of XP per time spent.\nAnd the moderation payout is slanted in their favor anyway. There's XP to be made for being in the majority, FFS, so whoever votes first tends to decide. Refusal is a tough step for most, as most societal human values discourage rejection, and in all honesty there's next to no guideline. Approval provides the slight element of pride \"I was good enough to solve this\".\nNo wonder the easy stuffs gets through.\n\nSource: authored an arguably broad spectrum of puzzle difficulty. (and didn't even bother working on more \"hardest\", because system)\n\n\n\nBTW, thanks to the both of you for being the occasional yet usual \"first-triers\" on the harder ones of mine :D",
