I've just edited the description in Input section to make it easier to understand. I've also added \"rows x cols lines\" to Output section.\n\nOriginal input section for reference:\n\nA 2-dimensional grid of pixels, with each pixel defined by its red, green, and blue values.\n\nThe first line of input gives the size of the grid, in rows and columns respectively.\nEach subsequent line contains a pixel's RGB values in a space-separated list. The pixels are given in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order.",
