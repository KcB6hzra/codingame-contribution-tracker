I'm trying now but unfortunately I can't see it in the ascii, even after training on stock images to be sure I'm doing it right. In truth there aren't many of those that I'm able to get anyway. And then once the focus is right, there's a question of what the shape even is, because some of them are quite weird. So my question now is, what makes a stereogram easier for viewing (and therefore better, in my opinion)? Why is it that I'm readily able to see so much more detail in some and not in others?",

Too wide and you can't \"unfocus\" your eyes enough to show the same piece of the pattern to each eye; too narrow and you overshoot, looking at the second or third iteration away.\n\nThe density of the pattern has to be right. A pattern that is too sparse doesn't give you much information to go on and makes it hard to find the focus.\n\nA depth map that is too deep or too complicated is hard to see too.\n\nThe pattern can be generated for either \"wide-eyed\" viewing (as here) or \"cross-eyed\". If you view it the wrong way, you end up with an inverted image - like seeing the mold instead of the casting.\n\nAdmitedly it's harder to see these ASCII versions, partly because the test cases are limited to 1000 total characters, so you really can't make the depth map wide enough to frame it with a few dozen 0s as I would have liked.",
