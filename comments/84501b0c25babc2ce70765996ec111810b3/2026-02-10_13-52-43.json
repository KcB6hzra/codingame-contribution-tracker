    "content": "Thanks for the feedback everyone.\n\n@nicola\nAre you saying that you suggest I use 'equation' instead of 'expression'? Looking up the definition of expression in mathematics, it gives an example of '2x3' as an expression, which goes along with the fact that I have used it correctly here. Sorry if I am misunderstanding.\n\n@JBM\nI suppose the reason I like the negation as part of the problem is that it adds one extra gotcha for those who plan to solve this by splitting the operators in reverse order. What I mean by that is, you could solve this by taking the expression and splitting by '*', then for each sub-element you can split by '-', then for each sub-element, split by '/', then split by '+', add each sub-element, divide each sub-element, etc. This type of solution leads to a rather ugly one-liner in languages like python, javascript, and ruby. Here's a working example for python (though it would not work for tests with negation):\n\nprint(reduce(operator.mul,[reduce(operator.sub,[reduce(operator.floordiv,[eval(exp3) for exp3 in exp2.split('/')]) for exp2 in exp.split('-')]) for exp in input().split('*')]))\n\nI feel like this type of solution takes a bit of the magic away from the problem. I had this in mind when adding the tests for the problem, and I thought adding in a negation would be a good speed bump in the road for those trying a solution like this.\n\nI'll remove it if you still think I should, but perhaps instead I could add something in the description to state that negate has the highest priority.\n\nLet me know what you think, and thanks again for the feedback.",
