And it can be problematic if it is hidden in the final puzzle.\n\nI explain :\n\nIn the validator 4, you dno't have all the informations about the square 2 just by reading the digits. The problem is that is for all others squares, you can just read all the digits and you already know the square size with just max(bottom- top, right - left). But for this 2 squares, you can't do just that. You have to see that you don't have all the informations of the squares and \"adjust\" to find the final size. Dealing with the \n\n\nAnd i there's an additional problem. You say  \"in order from the first one drawn to the last.\". In the validator 3, how are we suppose to know that the square 2 is the first ?",

My code would need to be somewhat more complicated to unravel something like this:\n\n.11111111\n.1......1\n.1......1\n.33333..1\n.3...3221\n.3...3..1\n444..3..1\n434333111\n444......\n\nSince only a single wall of the '2' square can be \"seen\", my code fails on this test case. Is this [obvious corner] constraint intended? Is it desired? Just wondering.",
