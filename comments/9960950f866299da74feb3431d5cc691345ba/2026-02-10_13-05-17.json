I'm probably not gonna approve this until more people have deemed the difficulty appropriate. I would support an easy/medium puzzle version of this, like StepBack13 talked about.\n\n* People glossing over your statement (like I did, trying to implement it as quickly as possible) might miss the fact that you need to jump *after* the corresponding \"]\". Could you maybe try highlighting the word \"after\" in <<bold>>? It might jump out too much, so use at your own discretion.\n* You should probably add somewhere that all outputs should be on the same line, without any separator character.\n* Your string of allowed characters still contains a comma (both in the goal statement and in the constraints), which you probably want to remove.",

    "content": "This is definitely too hard for Reverse.\n\nI tried it and thought I was getting somewhere but then it turned out I was not at all. Looked at the statement and realised this is way too complex to reverse-engineer.\n\nThe statement never explains what \",\" does, but it doesn't seem to appear in tests. Also, \"Peek the stack\" isn't explained either. \"top of stack\" is also ambiguous for someone who hasn't learned about stack-based programming. You also don't explain that \"/\" is integer division. You also don't explain that if you see multiple \"=\" then you print output on the same line, without spaces/newlines. Then when you get to the loops, it's a whole new level of difficulty after getting past all the previous hurdles... then I see you've even got nested loops! ಠ_ಠ\n\nI think this looks too hard for a clash, really. I don't think someone who isn't already well-versed in such languages could solve this in 15 minutes from this statement.  It would make a nice Easy puzzle, though.",

    "content": "I think the simplifications for Fastest/Shortest would probably be ok, a little on the hard side but doable.\n\nFor Reverse, it's maybe doable with those extra simplifications, but the hardest part is really understanding how the stack works without a statement explaining that it's a stack. It's easy enough when it's just individual operations \"23+=\", \"56*=\", but when you perform operations on the results it can get confusing without knowing what's happening. I first tried to solve this with repeated RegEx substitutions and the issue was that if you replace \"57*\" with \"35\" then it's hard to parse the next operation because you've got a multi-digit result. e.g. \"57*23*-=\" -> \"356-=\" then it's unclear whether to do \"3-56\" or \"35-6\" etc. Of course, it's not a good way to solve this, but in Reverse mode, people often try naive solutions like that... expecting them to guess that they need to use a real stack might be asking a bit too much without explaining it.",
