The input format is simple and easy to understand, and the output is clearly specified.",

    "content": "Nice and easy problem about a cool subject!\n\nSmall details:\n• Goal section: missing \"of\" in \"Given the number of layers\"\n• Input section: for line 2, I would write \"The number [[n]] of nodes of each layer\"\n• Example section: for someone who does not know anything about neural networks, the example 2 3 2 could be misleading because 2*3*2 = 12, which is the correct answer, but uses the wrong computation (it should be computed as 2*3 + 3*2). I would suggest to change it to 2 3 1 (with 9 as output, clearly not 2*3*1). And with this small change, I think you could even propose it for reverse mode.",
