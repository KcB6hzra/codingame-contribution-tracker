I thought that once the idea is clear, coding the solution should not take too many minutes (it's not difficult to calculate x in [3 4 x], neither is it difficult in [x 2 4]; this puzzle *just* combines that a bit horizontally and vertically). I might however overlook how much minutes I subconsciously spent while designing this Clash, so that I lost feeling with how much minutes it takes for someone seeing this Clash for the first time, like during actual COC play.\n\nI've no clear idea on how to alter this clash to make it easier (and it's definitely too easy for an easy Classic Puzzle), so I'll leave it hanging here for a bit longer and just remove it if it does not get the approval or more disapproval in the coming days.",
