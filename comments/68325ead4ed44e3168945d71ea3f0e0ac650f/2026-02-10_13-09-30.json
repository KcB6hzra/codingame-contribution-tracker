I have one question:\n- is the case of 'pile of 1, odd moves' very important to you? It is the only case for which the final sentence of your statement (and the output 'EMPTY') is needed. It feels like removing this case, the final sentence of the statement, and the 'EMPTY' option (and setting N to 2<=N<=100) would cut away about 30% of the statement/explanation, while it only removes 5% of the puzzle experience / required coding. In other words, a possible way to make your clash more efficient while just as fun.",

Changing the possible number of moves, to never be bigger than the size of the pile. It doesn't add too much to have the 2^31 -1 moves test.\n2. Changing the input so the pile is read from bottom to top. This allows pushing into a stack more easily.\n\nThe negative with those changes is that it makes it easier to use a stack data structure to simulate the puzzle instead of understanding the logic. That is also why I called it a pile instead of a stack.",

    "content": "You answered my question: you have a good reason to keep 'EMPTY' in so that's ok. The two changes you propose:\n1. Actually having a k bigger than the pile was one of the steps for which I needed to change my code, so for the same reason of having 'EMPTY' in (a case to pay special attention to), I would opt for keeping that in;\n2. The effect of the top/bottom or bottom/top I do not fully understand. I am not 'pushing' anything (I think); I solved the puzzle logically:\n\nprint('EMPTY' if n==k%2==1 else elements[1] if k==1 else max(elements[:k+1]))\n\nIf input is reorganized bottom/top I should reverse my list elements first; so that change would make my code less efficient.\n\nSo, in fact I am saying that I understand your 'EMPTY' reasoning and I would opt against the two changes you propose, which implies I can approve. Let me do that right now.",
