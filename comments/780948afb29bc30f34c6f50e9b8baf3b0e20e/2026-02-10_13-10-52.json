    "content": "Hello! I thought about adding that in the constraints area but since it's in one of the tests + the name of the test is a huge hint, I thought of not adding it. But since, there's the possibility of this CoC being the in the fastest mode, maybe it's better to have it there than just in the tests. Therefore, I made that change. Also, the reverse mode thing might be a good idea but I'm not sure if people would understand the tests and the concept behind it. It's hard to tell what the % is about. Let me know if you still think that is possible. Also, can you please upvote so that other people see it? Thanks for the input!",
