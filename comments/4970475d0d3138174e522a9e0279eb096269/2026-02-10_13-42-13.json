Now consider that one member of the population becomes \"infected\" by a virus. Provided a set of connections (i.e. \"member A is linked to member B\"), the subset of members of the population infected by the virus can be simulated (we will assume that transmission is guaranteed to occur between linked members). This subset is effectively like an \"outbreak\" of a virus.\n\nYour job is to assess these subsets, or <<clusters>> and provide the breakdown of the distribution of cluster sizes in the given population.\n\nNOTE: All links are two-way, there are no one-way links.\n\nGiven a population size [[N]], with members indexed from {{0}} to {{N-1}}, calculate the size of every outbreak/cluster within the population.\n\nInput:\n\n<<Line 1:>> A number, [[N]], of members of the population\n<<Line 2:>> A number, [[L]], of links within the population\n<<Next L lines:>> Two space-separated integers representing the indexes of two linked members of the population\n\nOutput:\n\n<<Line 1:>> Two space-separated integers representing the size and frequency of the largest sized cluster.\n<<Line 2:>> Two space-separated integers representing the size and frequency of the 2-nd largest sized cluster\n... and so on:\n<<Last Line:>> Two space-separated integers representing the size and frequency of the smallest sized cluster\n\nConstraints:\n\n{{5}} <= [[N]] <= {{500}}\n{{800}} > L\nEvery member of the population belongs to a cluster",

To the opposite, in fact.\n\nI enjoyed the challenge of this problem which took me ~3hours of head scratching ending in 82 lines of JavaScript.\n\nBut I have suggestions about the puzzle instructions:\n\nI deducted expected output from the test case attempts in the IDE. \"size of the biggest cluster number of clusters of this size\" just mystified me...\n\nI would replace the word \"cluster(s)\" with \"group(s)\" in the description, globally.\n\nI would keep the first sentence of the description: \"In this puzzle, we look at the GROUPS of person who can be infected by a virus in a given population.\"\n\nAnd I would discard the rest in favor of:\n\nYour challenge is to identify all the groups of persons having a relationship.\nEach separate group having absolutely no relation with any other group.\nAnd produce a report about all existing group size.\n\nInputs: (keep as is)\nOutputs: n lines, one for each groups sizes. Each lines containing two integers, \"group size\" and \"group count\" for this group size, separated by a space.\nConstraints: (keep as is)",
