    "content": "I had this as a clash, and I also believe it's not impossible in 15 minutes.\nOf course, the guideline is not whether it can be done in 15 minutes, but whether it can be done in 5.\nI suppose I could do it using a stack, where I push whatever is after \"SUM(\" and pop after \")\", in order to parse left to right. But I'd also have to add checking for commas, making sure there are no other characters at all, etc.\nMy conclusion is that it is too difficult for Clash of Code and, honestly, not a very interesting problem to work through. Some will say that it is similar to actual work tasks, but 1. I don't buy that, and 2. that's not why I do clashes.",

    "content": "I agree.\nPython & co will almost always have an advantage over C/C++ in CoC that's just the way it is. That said, I think this clash is too dependent on eval, so much so that is probably impossible to solve, in time, without it.\nIf you really want to go with it, I would consider making the test cases easier because, in effect, the nested test cases add zero complexity if you are using eval, while making the problem unsolvable without it.\nAlso the statement needs more clarity. You need to define what mathematical operators are allowed, otherwise it is impossible to know what an \"invalid character\" is.\n Also the solution you have provided would accept test cases like =SUM(++5,--5) which could conceivably be considered invalid, if parsed manually. And, since validators are hidden, a player cannot know whether such a case is present or not.",
