Additionally, the conversion of numbers to binary representation using built-in functions can cause issues in some programming languages. You should increase the complexity of the problem to make it more challenging and should provide clearer instructions on how to perform the binary conversion manually.",

You can have a 1 line solution. The answer for a number N is just (N%16 + N%8) in base 2. N%16 is N modulo 16.",
