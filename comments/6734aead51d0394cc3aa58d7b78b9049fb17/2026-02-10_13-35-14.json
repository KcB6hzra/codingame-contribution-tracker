    "content": "I like this task. At first, I thought it would be easy but couldn't come up with a solution other than counting up the Fibonacci numbers until i is found. Is there a simpler way to find the previous number? I was surprised I had no timeout issues using this method.\n\nMaybe this would be nice for shortest mode? Reverse would be too hard for sure. Also maybe you could rename i to n or something because i is a standard iterator variable. Otherwise, I like the wording and everything. Good work!",

    "content": "Thanks for the feedback! I thought reverse would be interesting, to see if the player recognizes the Fibonacci Sequence. Might be worth a shot, we'll see what others say.\n\nAs for a simpler method, I managed to solve it with 49 characters in JS but I'm sure a pro could get it in even less. There is in fact a formula that allows you to find the previous number without counting... You could probably find it with a quick Google search, or just think about it for a while, it's relatively simple.\n\nGood point about misusing 'i', I was thinking i for integer. I'll go ahead and fix that now.",
