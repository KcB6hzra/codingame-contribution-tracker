    "content": "This looks like the start of a decent CoC. A couple of things though:\n\n- In Validator 1, \"1\" and \"512\" have the same number of 1's in their binary representation. Same with Test 2, \"-3\" and \"-5\".\n- I would not include negative numbers since it doesn't add anything to the puzzle. Also, there is a slight ambiguity about whether to include the 1 that represents the negative in signed integers.\n- Copy/move \"All given integers...\" to the constraints section.\n- If you want to include this in reverse mode, you should definitely have the first or second test sort \"63 31 15 7 3 1 0\" or maybe \"64 96 112 120 124 126 127\". Otherwise, I think it would be too much to guess what it is.",
