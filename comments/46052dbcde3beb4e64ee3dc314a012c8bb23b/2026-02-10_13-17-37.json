    "content": "I am doubting whether to also include the string {{point}}, and open the door to floats. I.e.: input could also be {{two hundred two ten five point one five}} for 225.15 (with as rule that after the decimal point, all numbers are simply spelled one by one, without use of ten or hundred).\n\nAnd, another thing: I think this one is also possible in Reverse mode (which is what I want), but possibly I need to add more tests to show the reverse-players the fact that there are either one-string, or three-string or five-string inputs for 0-9, 10-99 or 100-999. In other words, my question: is it clear enough for Reverse as it is, or shall I add some Test cases?",
