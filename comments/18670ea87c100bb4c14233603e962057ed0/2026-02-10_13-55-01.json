    "content": "I don't like this one. In my opinion, use a binary representation of a number to calculate like a decimal number is not logical. I'm sorry but I vote to refuse.\n\nA number can have a decimal representation (eg. 13) and a binary representation (eg. 1101). This 2 representations indicate the same value: \"13 on base 10\" = \"1101 on base 2\". In my opinion, it's confusing to calculate \"1101 on base 2\" and to work with the number \"1101 on base 10\" (not the same).\n\nBut a lot of puzzles about binary conversion can be very good, like count the number of 1, the ratio of 1...",
