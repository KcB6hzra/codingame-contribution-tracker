    "content": "1. I like how \"DFS\" is embedded in the title of this puzzle.\n\n2. Interesting to discover that a few people have different genders in the test cases and the corresponding validators.\n\n3. Explanation below the tree diagram: Do you mean leaving the tree on your \"right\" hand instead of \"left\" hand?\n\n4. Suggest rewording: \"For siblings of the same person, the male descendants are ordered before the female descendants.\" (NOT same sibling)\n\n5. Suggest all the rules be grouped together in point/bullet form in the statement section. Roughly like this:\n\n<<Ordering rules>>\n(a) in order of generation\n(b) in order of gender\n(c) in order of age (year of birth)\n\n<<Outputting rules>>\n(a) exclude dead people\n(b) exclude people who are catholic (but include siblings of catholic people)\n\n6. Inputs:\n\"Date of birth/death\" should be revised as \"Year of birth/death\".\n\n7. Constraints:\n* The point on people alive should be moved to \"Input\" section. (NOT really a constraint)\n* Don't print (etc) should be moved to statement rule section as described in point 5 above. (NOT really a constraint)\n* Also suggest changing \"don't print\" to \"don't output\" or \"exclude from the output\".\n* Suggest adding a constraint that \"No two siblings of the same gender of a person have the same year of birth.\"\n\n8. Suggest renaming all validators to be the same as the corresponding test cases.\n\n9. Issues in test case 4 (\"Non anglican people\") / validator 4:\n\nLadyMarinaCharlotteWindsor is listed to have \"GeorgeWindsorEarlofStAndrews\" as her parent, but the parent's name is listed as \"GeorgeWindsorEofStAndrews\".\n\nFloraOgilvy is listed to have \"amesOgilvy\" instead of \"JamesOgilvy\" as her parent.\n\n10. Issue with default python code: Error occurs for people with year of death of \"-\" as it is not an integer.",

    "content": "Thank you for the prompt fixes. Some more still...\n\n1. In response to your question \"Who?\": I've thrown away the list after checking... but I remember there are several in test case/validator 4, and one in test case/validator 3 (PrincessCharlotteofCambridge: F in test case and M in validator).\n\n2. Explanation below the tree diagram: What's the difference between \"walk around it\" and \"folloinoing (sic, typo there) the tree on your left hand)? I think it's not very clear...\n\nNew rewording suggestion: \"You see the order of succession: begin on the left of the tree, walk to the next level whenever possible otherwise continue to the right. Repeat until the whole tree is covered.\"\n\n3. Goal\nSuggest changing \"write down\" to \"output\". Also change \"D's childs\" to \"D's children\".\n\n4. Paragraph before \"Ordering rules\"\n\"the order of succession in this sibling\" should be revised as \"the order of succession of these siblings\"\n\n5. Ordering rules\nYou've followed my rough suggestion, and I described it as \"rough\" because I don't know how to present it better. I guess my suggestion may be interpreted as a BFS order...? Or am I just over-thinking about it?\n\n6. Input\n\"death date\" should be revised as \"year of death\".\n\n7. Although the corresponding validator has been fixed, the same issue with LadyMarinaCharlotteWindsor's parent in test case 4 isn't fixed yet (see point 9 in my last comment).",
