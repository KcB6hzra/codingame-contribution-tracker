But you need to think quite a bit to get there, so it's probably between easy and medium.\n\nAnyways, I had fun solving it, everything is well-explained, so I'll gladly accept it.\n\nAnd if it isn't too late for suggestions, I would have liked to see both n=38 and n=37 as test cases, just for debugging reasons (to have the case of \"max pins in a round <= 12\").",

Having just worked on String Balls and String Balls II, I feel like I've done a lot of dynamic programming recently, but I still stumbled around for longer than seemed necessary before I solved this puzzle. IMO, there is no such thing as too much practice with dynamic programming. Great job!",
