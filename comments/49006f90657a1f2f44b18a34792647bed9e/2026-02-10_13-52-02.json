Sorry about the mess.\n\nAlso, sorry about this: hexadecimal (the current input format) is *not* Right. Octal would be Right. I'll likely rewrite it in octal. It'll be so much better in octal. If you're moderating this before I update again, make sure your code isn't that hard to convert to octal, because this  puzzle will most likely end up in octal.\n\nIn the meantime, plus sides for me:\n* input format makes sense again\n* the TID overheating part is dropped, because there's actually a nice and easy puzzle to be made out of it. Stay tuned.",
