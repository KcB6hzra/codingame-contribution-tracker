    "content": "I'm going to give you an approval, but I have a few very minor suggestions that I also see now:\n\n~ It sort of bothers me that \"N\" is a variable for a string, since \"N\" is normally associated with a number.  Maybe call it NYD or NewYearsDay.\n\n~ Suggest changing \"celebrate a big birthday party\" \nto \n\"celebrate a big birthday with a party\" \nor \n\"celebrate with a big birthday party\"\n\n~ Suggest to change the formatting on  \nMONDAY, ... ,SUNDAY \nand\nMONDAY,TUESDAY,WEDNESDAY,THURSDAY,FRIDAY,SATURDAY,SUNDAY\nto be formatted as constants, instead of bold\n\n~ For the test you are calling Christmas, you are using the date (Dec 24) which is the day before Christmas, at least in USA; is it different elsewhere?  Consider changing the name of the test or the date used in it",
