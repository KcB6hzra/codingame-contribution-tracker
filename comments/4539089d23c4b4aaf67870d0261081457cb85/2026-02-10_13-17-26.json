Please remove.  I cannot approve this with that there. I'd even love to see Shortest go.  There is no time margin to add additional work.\n5) Perhaps \"si\" should be \"ti\"?  This is the common phrasing for Tonic Solfa notation (at least in English and the movie \"Sound of Music\").  See: \nhttps://violinspiration.com/do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do/",

Perhaps if Test 1 was a simple treble scale (like Test 2 is for baritone), it would be possible to figure out in time.\n\nTreble clef \"la\" is never used.",
