    "content": "Alright so I solved it and my main concern is that you shouldn't need to optimize your code for a clash of code.\n\nWith n exceeding the 100 millions, you have to rethink your way of solving it and that's a huge nono for me. Clashes are supposed to be short and simple. Puzzles require optimization. Do not mix them up.\n\nWith optimization, you completely ruin the fun of code golfing (since your options are very limited) and make reverse mode even harder. It's gonna be very frustrating and I'm sure most of the players will never get 100% on this clash.\n\nIf there was another clash mode for optimization (like a code golf but your score is evaluated on the performances), this would fit perfectly but right now I don't think this constraint on n should be this big.",
