    "content": "Nice clash. :)\n\nSolved in 5 minutes, but I was confused about what \"first\" means in this context...\n\nYour solution prioritises having a small row co-ordinate over a small col co-ordinate, but that's not clear in the statement.\n\nI tested both methods and they both get 100% so it doesn't matter with your tests, but the lack of clarity was a bit confusing. If you had a test case where \"0 5\" was a valid answer but so was \"1 0\" then it's arguable that \"1 0\" is closer to the top-left and therefore should win, but your code would preference \"0 5\" because it checks rows first.\n\nMaybe you could reword it as:\n\"The first valid area being the <<top-most>> (1st priority) and <<left-most>> (2nd priority) coordinates.\"\n\nAlso, Validator 1 is the only test case where the answer is the very last corner - a literal 'corner case' 😅\nIt's probably good to move this a bit later and have a matching test case for it. It's easy to get confused with the ranges you're checking here and forget to check the final bounds:\nI found these tests and validators fail when you mess up h and/or w ranges by 1:\nboth: V1,V2,T3,T5,V5\nh: V1,V2,T3,V5\nw: V1",

    "content": "Seems like a straightforward puzzle :) Some minor thoughts I had:\n\n- The \"height\" of the land and the \"height\" of the home seemed to be referring to the same thing at first. Also somewhat related: \"width\" could be ambiguous when relating to the grid.\n- For clarity, consider stating that the house should not be rotated (i.e., a 3x1 house should not be built on a 1x3 plot of land).\n- Consider specifying constraints so that players will know to consider the brute-force solution :)\n- For clarity, you can define what \"first\" valid area means: scanning the grid by row from top to bottom, scanning left to right for each row, and selecting the first found area. Although, I think this should be rather intuitive once players see the test cases.",
