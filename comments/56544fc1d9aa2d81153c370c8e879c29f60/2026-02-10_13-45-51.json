Yet in the input section, N becomes the total number of stops in line 1 and reused in the constraints section as such. Also, in the code S actually represents the list in line 2.\n\nI also do not quite understand the example. The last entry of line 3 is 4, which means the person at stop 2 needs to stay for another 4 stops. Isn't the terminus supposed to be at 'stop 3'?",

I made a mistake about the last constraint which should have been 0 < Time duration for each person <= \"N\" and not \"S\" and about the example, so I'll fix that for sure (besides that, even with a nice code it would change nothing)\n\nAs I said, it would have been 3 and not 4, so that would mean that specific guy would stay \"in theory\" for 3 stops. Since that duration value is greater than the value of the remaining stops (3 > 1), that means he will stay until the end of the line.\n\nNothing really much tricky here though..",

Neither is it intuitive from the problem's context (who would interpret the input duration as an arbitrary number that is greater than or equal to the actual duration?). It is not easy for people to grasp that logic which is the key to solve the problem. It would be nice if the inputs can be changed to the actual duration with the (N+1)th stop as the terminus. If you do not want that, at least the logic needs to be clearly explained in the problem statement.",
