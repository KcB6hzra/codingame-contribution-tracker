Running the simulation step by step, one can see that the pattern ywxiywxiy... starts at 12. In other word the 12th move ends on the y and then every 4 moves goes back to y. Therefore 12 + 4 + 4 ... = 216 not 215.\nThen the formula is (12345678912 - 12) % 4 or (12345678912 - 216) % 4 if you prefer and the result is 0 so the cursor will arrive exactly at the same place as the start of the loop, the letter y.\nI am curious as to how you get the value 215.",
