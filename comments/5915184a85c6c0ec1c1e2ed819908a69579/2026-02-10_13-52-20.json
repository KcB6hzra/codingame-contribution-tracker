    "content": "Goal\n* I moved the first example to after the opcode table.\n\n* I added an explanation on how register overflow or underflow should be handled:\n\nEach register can only hold values between 0 and 255 (inclusive). Any operation that results in a value outside this range must wrap around using modulo 256 arithmetic to stay within 8 bits.\n\n* I removed the following from the explanation on <<20xy>> as it's now redundant after the above amendment:\nOnly the lowest 8-bits are stored in register x.\n\n* For <<20xy>>, I replaced \"if\" with \"Then, if\" and added \"(before adjusting for overflow) to clarify the order of updating the register and which result to check.\n\n* For <<30xy>>, I replaced \"if register x < register y\" with \"Then, if the result (before adjusting for underflow) is less than 0\" to clarify the order of updating the register and avoid the confusion about whether the register x value before or after subtraction should be used for the comparison.\n\nDifficulty\n* In view of the high success rate (73%, 708 CodinPlayers at this moment), I lowered the difficulty rating from Hard to Medium.\n\nSolution\n* Amended the code for 30xy to update register 2 with the flag (0 or 1) AFTER subtraction instead of before.",

So I see it as \"different enough\" and vote to approve.",
