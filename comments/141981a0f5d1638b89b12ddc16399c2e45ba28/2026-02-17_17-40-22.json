    "content": "[Goal: Lychrel Background and Rules]\n\n- The reverse-and-add process already states that numbers have to be operated on (reversed and added) in its original base. Consider removing the corresponding rule.\n\n- Consider specifying in step 3 of the reverse-and-add process that leading zeros of the resultant number should be discarded. You can then remove the corresponding rule.\n\n- I would condense the description of Lychrel numbers to: \"Applying the reverse-and-add process repeatedly to most numbers eventually results in palindromic output. But some numbers, expressed in some bases, do not produce any palindromic output after {{1000}} iterations. For this puzzle, these numbers will be called Lychrel numbers.\" You can add on more details of Lychrel numbers or even further reading (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number) at the end of the description.\n\n[Goal: Task]\n\n- Numbers are written using digits *0*-9 and letters A-Z. Here, I would recommend moving this to the Input description instead. Your task can simply be stated as \"Given a number [[number]] of base [[base]], your task is to determine ...\".\n\n- Consider specifying that at least one iteration has to be performed: \"... your task is to determine the first palindromic number obtained by applying the reverse-and-add process <<at least once>> (even if the original number is palindromic).\" You can then remove the corresponding rule.\n\n[Constraints]\n\n- Please specify that range of original numbers in the constraints section. E.g.: 1 < [[number]] (in base 10) < 10^140.\n\n- Consider specifying an upper bound on the number of characters expected in the output. E.g.: length of output < 250.\n\n- Please add a constraint where the original number contains no leading zeros.",

(Test 12).\n\n* The base is 10 in 7 out of 12 pairs of cases. Please add a new pair of cases where:\n\n  • the base is not used in any existing cases,\n  • the starting number is a palindrome,\n  • and if possible, the starting number has more than 100 digits and requires more than 99 iterations to reach a palindrome. If this isn't possible, please use the largest feasible number of digits and iterations.\n\nCover picture\n* Consider uploading a cover picture for the puzzle.\n\nThanks.",

I think that all your suggestions have been considered in the new version. \nIt's a bit hard to provide \"extreme\" case in other basis as there are very few results in the litterature for basis different from 10. However, I added some cases for palindromic original numbers in different bases. And there are now the two most delayed palindromic numbers known so far investigated into the last Test/Validator pair.",
