    "content": "Nice clash, harder than it looks, since you are dealing with discrete increases in the robot population that don't align with your variable n beyond the 3 day mark!\n\nAfter a bit of stumbling, you realise a simple loop can solve it all for you. :)\n\nOne thing that isn't actually clarified, but is a very subtle issue, is that you implicitly assume the robots all work on a single robot at a time here. Whereas \"The rate of work [being] directly proportional to the number of robots\" would still be true if they worked in parallel, say \"Robots work together on a single robot if the number of robots is odd, or on two robots when even, \"3 robots when the number is divisible by 3\", ... (with later rules superseding earlier ones). This would make the problem far more confusing, so your simplification is crucial, but it would be good to just add an explicit line saying to assume they all work on a single robot at a time.\n\nPerhaps it would be clearer to just explicitly state:\n\"The time taken to complete a new robot is always 2 days / [[r]], where [[r]] is the number of robots at that point in time\". Then this removes the possibility of the proportionality changing, and removes the need to think about how the robots are organising their labour.",
