One might assume that the input is fixed as either fahrenheit or celsius and therefore only needs to be converted if odd/even, but really it needs to be converted regardless.\n\nYou could clarify this under \"Input\" by saying:\n[[D]] An integer for the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (if odd) or Celsius (if even).",
