Each tier above is a smaller square, with each side containing one less cannonball than the tier below. This continues until a single cannonball sits at the top. For example, a valid two-tiered pyramid has a base of four cannonballs in a 2×2 square, with one resting on top.\"",

Except for edge cases, each test should be different from validators. But they should be similar enough so that what the player can see during coding is similar to what they are assessed after code submission.\n\nTest = visible case for coding\nValidator = hidden case for calculating final score\n\nFor example, you may set the input of Test 2 as 819 and that of Validator 2 as 506.",
