Instead, if you end a turn with only one fruit left, you win.",

While the story is nice, the statement is a bit unclear:\n\n- I wasn't sure what the \"stock\" was when I first read it.\n- The variable n is only referenced once, so it's unclear what it's referring to.\n- I didn't understand how there could be fruit \"left over\" in the first line if no fruit was ever removed from it while building the second line.\n- I didn't understand how fruit from the first line could be \"scooped to the blender\" if there are no fruit left over on the first line.\n\nThe examples definitely helped (especially since they used the word \"replace\" instead of the word \"spread\"), but I felt that they could have been illustrated more graphically, perhaps somewhat like this:\n\nFFFFF FFFFF FFFFF\nB B B\nO\nW",
