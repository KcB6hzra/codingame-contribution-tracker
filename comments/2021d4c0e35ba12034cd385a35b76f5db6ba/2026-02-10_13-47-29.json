The sequence definition is clearly created by someone who never seen numbers in order. Everything about this clash is just plain bad. What is that nonsense about not whole numbers? Sigh... This will haunt me in my dreams.",

I guess someone already fixed 5th validator.\nI want to approve it, but i think that this clash would be hard for reverse mode, because you have to guess that:\n1) its a sequence (mb easy)\n2) you have to print ERROR on wrong operators (mb easy)\n3) you have to print ERROR on negative number\nSecond thing is that in my JS solution i didn't round my output at all, and i pass all the test, so you have to add test case for it, or remove it from Statement\nIf you will fix those i can approve it :)",
