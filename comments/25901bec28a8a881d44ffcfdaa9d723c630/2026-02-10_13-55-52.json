    "content": "Well, to make an all-purpose solver might be a significant challenge. Honestly, I haven't tried. But the tests could be designed such that a less complete solution is required. For example:\n\n1234567890 8 2\n2134567890 6 4\n1243567890 6 4\n1234657890 7 3\n1234568790 6 4\n1234567809 7 3\n\nThis would not be feasible to solve via brute-force, but you could write a relatively simple algorithm that solves this problem.\n\nThis is similar to the Skynet: The Chasm puzzle. Many people find that problem to be overwhelming based on the problem statement, but the tests are actually designed so that the algorithm doesn't need to be very sophisticated.\n\nMaybe it's not as feasible as I initially thought. I honestly haven't put much thought into it. I think it's a decent puzzle as-is. :-)",
