When I tried to make my own multidimensional point type anything over 4 dimensions was too slow. I had to resort to dynamic typing and writing routines to go between arrays and runtime length tuples but in the end, I was able to pass all tests.",

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperrectangle )\n\n* Please add this clarification:\nValid coordinate values in each dimension range from 0 to size of that dimension - 1.\n\n* \"the intersecting area remains an obstacle\" may be confusing, as \"area\" usually implies two dimensions. Consider changing it to:\n\nthe intersections remain obstacles\n\n* Example:\n  • Please add a blank line below the second instance of \"z=0   z=1   z=2\", the same as you did for the first instance.\n\n  • Please change \"the following one (path cells are numbered from 0 to 7):\" to:\n\n    shown below, with each step numbered from 0 (start) to 7 (destination).\n\n  • The input specifies the start position as 1,2,0 and the destination as 2,0,0, but the illustrations show the start at 2,1,0 and the destination at 0,2,0.

But any BFS should do the trick (that's why I had to keep it so small, a 10 cells sided cube in 8D is already 10^8 cells in total). I think it's not too hard for anyone who knows basic pathfinding algorithm. It's just one tweak away from the classic 2D solution.",
