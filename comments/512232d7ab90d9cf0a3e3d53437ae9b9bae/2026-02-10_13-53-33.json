    "content": "Got rid of my last off-by-one and solved it (my approach summed per remaining eggs directly instead of splitting like eulerscheZahl's, made it harder to spot the missing 0-tries segment on top of the building) (still passed 80%, ugh).\n\nSo good to go for me, but I do have to report I didn't need memoizing of any sort. What ought to make this problem intractable by basic recursion is the number of \"splits\" in the theoretical resolution; if I'm not mistaken it's in the order of 2^T provided T<=E, but that's seldom the case here.\n\nThere seems to be a closed form lurking.",

Count the number of floors you can cover as follows:\nif you only have one egg, you can cover t floors (time is the limiting point).\nif t <= remaining eggs, binary search gives 2^m - 1\nfor t = 1 you can obviosly cover one floor\notherwise do recursion: floors(t, k) = 1 + floors(t-1, k) + floors(t-1, k-1), where k is the number of remaining eggs.\nIncrement t, until you can cover enough floors.\n\nAdd a lookup table and you can easyly solve the problem for numbers close to 2^31 floors.",
