    "content": "[Goal]\n\n- Please remove the second line \"Split the ASCII string into lines at each /.\" This instruction is already covered in more detail by the third line.\n\n- Consider changing \"no visible characters\" to \"only whitespace characters (spaces and line breaks)\". Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character\n\n[Input / Output]\n\n- Please shift \"Illegal output.\" from the Input section to the Output section.\n\n[Constraints]\n\n- Remove the line \"If all output... 'Illegal output'.\". This is a rule, not a constraint.\n\n- Is there any reason why \"/\" cannot appear at the end of the final input line? You have a test case \"Leading and trailing '/'\" that allows for \"/\" to be the very first character, and you expect the output to contain a leading line break. This would make for a good edge case for a trailing \"/\" character also.\n\n[Cases]\n\n- Please refer to the case coverage comment by @YALOKGAR.\n\n- Currently, the max n for all test cases is 20. Please add more test cases where n is much larger (consider 50, 75, 100), or consider revising your constraint instead.\n\n- Please add a test case similar to Validator 4, where there is one (or more) trailing \"/\" character on one line and one (or more) leading \"/\" character on the next line.\n\n- Please add a test case where the resulting output only contains spaces (and no line breaks).\n\nThank you.",
