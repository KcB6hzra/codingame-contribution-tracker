    "content": "Thank you for the approval.\nI agree, the simple solution does require a little bit more brain activity than usual, but I really enjoy those kinds of puzzles myself. There are really too many clash of code puzzles that are no-brainers.\n\nI think it's possible to perform a real search. When I first attempted to solve it that way it took me about 10 minutes to complete the solution.\nBut if you are referring to the time required to run the program that does the search, you might be right that it could timeout with the longest test case, but then it just makes it more incentivizing to figure out the simpler solution to turn the 75% pass rate into a 100% pass rate.",
