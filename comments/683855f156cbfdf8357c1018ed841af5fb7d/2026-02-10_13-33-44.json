Also other cases are not well defined, for example true time 8:01:00 AM would be associated to observed time 8:01:59.75 AM.",

    "content": "Thanks for your comments.\nThis is my first contirbution so I may be missing a lot of points.\nAs you've mentioned the tests avoid dealing with fractions of a second. This is done on purpose. If you imagine a real world railway station clock this makes sense as it is highly unlikely to see the accuracy of 0.5s or even 0.25s when refering to a physical clock (being analog or digital).\nInitially I wanted to state in the goal that true time should be rounded to the nearest second. But then I decided that providing the format in the constraints and the example would suffice.\nIf you think this is not enough I can add this requirement (rounding to whole seconds) which should still pass all tests.\nI'd prefer not to go with the complex cases like in your example because of the reasons laid above.\nMany thanks.",
