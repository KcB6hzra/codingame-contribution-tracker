    "content": "It is probably obvious for people familiar with the game, but at first I got wrong a lot of details, like the way to identify words to score (any longest line of characters of length 2 or more that includes 1 or more just-played tiles) and the way scoring itself works (I was wrong at first using multipliers on old tiles, and later not counting the values of old tiles).\n\nI don't think the statement is at fault, life is just full of edge cases. But two sentences that confused me were:\n\n1. \"the word you have just played\" ... \"you scored by playing this word\" -> because the player has not exactly played a word, the player plays one or more tiles that are part of one or more words\n2. \"summing up the scores of the tiles\" -> I wasn't sure if this meant all of the tiles in the word or only the new ones, looking at the tests it became obvious\n\nI wouldn't really change anything because adding more text might make it even more confusing, and going to wikipedia solved all my problems. Again, very nice puzzle. 👍",

    "content": "Oh, makes sense.\n\nI finally passed all tests. I only needed to fix that and to sort the strings when outputting.\n\nGreat puzzle, I solved it in C thinking it was going to be an easy ride but oh man was I wrong. 200 lines and many SEGFAULTS later here we are.\n\nI haven't double checked the statement but this are my very minor remarks:\n\n- \"The score is calculated by first summing up the scores of the tiles. If any tile falls on l/L, the score of that tile is doubled/tripled before summing up. After the sum is found, apply the w/W multipliers to the sum if any tile falls on those cells, and you get the final score.\nIf you play on several w or W, the multipliers are applied successively.\n\nNote that special cells are effective only for new tiles, they aren't for tiles previously played.\"\n\n>> Maybe the note is not needed if you add a played here:\n\n\"The score is calculated by first summing up the scores of the tiles. If any JUST PLAYED tile falls on l/L, the score of that tile is doubled/tripled before summing up. After the sum is found, apply the w/W multipliers to the sum if any JUST PLAYED tile falls on those cells, and you get the final score.\nIf you play on several w or W, the multipliers are applied successively.\n\n(NO NOTE)\"\n\nwithout caps, these I added for visibility.\n\n- The references should probably be at the bottom? (And now that you explained everything maybe they are not even necessary? in case you want to golf the statement :P)\n\n--\n\nAlso I think my solution should not be valid, I will try to post once I find a counterexample.",
