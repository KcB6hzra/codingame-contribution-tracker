    "content": "I've changed the Constrains.\nThey were:\n0 ≤ [[N]] ≤ 100000000000\nI've changed to:\n1 ≤ [[N]] length ≤ 11\n\nReasoning:\n\nYour tests do not cover one corner case of 100000000000. That is crucial because the shortest solution known to me is:\np (gets.to_i(2)^m=682)-m (Ruby; credit to TheCrucial)\nBut it wouldn't work for 100000000000. And old constrains are saying that 100000000000 is possible so it shouldn't be getting 100%.\n\nN=0 is not possible because \"Input negative binary number always starts with '1' (at the top digit).\"\n\nAlso, it's not so clear if it is in bit or dec or negative dec.\n\nAnd N is a string. It's not js so you can't compare strings.",

    "content": "Was semi-confusing at first. I personally think a bit more clarification on how the system works would be very beneficial. Additionally, if you're going to require the person to (eventually) read a number larger than an integer, you should set the stub generator to signify this, either change the way the input is read to either be a double or string please.\n\nOther than that, perfectly fine suggestion and would be happy to have this as a clash.",
