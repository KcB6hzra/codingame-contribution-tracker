Suggest to rewrite it as:\nA [[sequence]] which is none of the above molecules is {{artificial}}.\n\nInput\n* Please change \"{{Sequence}}\" to \"[[sequence]]\" (format as variable and in lowercase for consistency).\n\nOutput\n* Please change \"Sequence\" to \"sequence\" for consistency.\n\nConstraints\n* Please change \"Sequence\" to \"sequence\" for consistency.\n\nCases\n* Please swap the cases so that each pair of test and validator is similar.\n\nFor example, there are 4 validators where the sequence is artificial, but no tests covering the same situation.\n\nGame modes\n* I think it is too difficult to deduce all the rules in Reverse mode.\n\nThanks.",
