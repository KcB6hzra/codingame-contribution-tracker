    "content": "This is very confusingly explained. The operations from 1 to [[n]] is not how one solves this, and nor how you usually think about it.\n\nIt's best to explain the operations from [[n_0]] = [[n]] down to n_{k} = 1:\noperation_0: n_{i+1} := n_i / 2, if n_i is even\noperation_1: n_{i+1} := (3 * n_i + 1) / 2 if n_i is odd\n\nThis makes it a lot easier to understand for clashers than the way you wrote it. Also the \"if n_i % 3 == 2\" is very confusing since it isn't clear whether that implies that operation_1 should always be applied when this is true, and operation_0 whenever it isn't. Of course, it can't be the case since in reverse the path has many options, most not leading to the desired final n.\n\nNice clash basically, but the statement scares people off. I came first in my clash, but the other 3 clashers all got 0%. :(",

It's perfect for a competitive programming contest due to its balance of straightforward rules and the intellectual challenge it presents.",

Rather than simply coding some given steps, here a player needs to think for a bit, which is nice.\n\nPersonally I think that shortest might be interesting as well, because I suspect that there can differences in length for different approaches (in other words: shortest with this clash would not only mean 'do you have the shortest language', but also 'do you pick the shortest approach'  - at least that is what I suspect).",
