And so everyone in the CoC will get 80% success because validator #1's first repeated number is not prime (incidentally, val #1 is the only one of your tests/validators where the naive method doesn't work).\n\nHere's my recommended test suite:\n(1) 4 numbers, where 3 is the only duplicate\n(2) 8 numbers, with two prime duplicates, and 7 is the first repeated number\n(3) 8 numbers, with two duplicates and 6 is the first repeated number while 11 is the second\n(4) 10 numbers, with three duplicates, the first of which is even, the second of which is odd but not prime, and the last is prime\n(5) whatever you want, with N = 25 or so\n(6) whatever you want, with N = 100 or so\n\nI'm not a big fan of 10 <= N since there's so much information, but if you have strong feelings about keeping it that way, I'm okay with it.",

I will fix that!\n\nYes, I did think about having N be large could be a problem, and maybe not necessary. Definitly something I was looking for feedback on. \n\nI think your suggestions for the test cases are all valid, so I've implemented those now. Take a look and see if you agree :)",
