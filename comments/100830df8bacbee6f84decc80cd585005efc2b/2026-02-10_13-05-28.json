    "content": "Nice clash, but currently there's an issue where a lazy solution can get 100% on tests and validators. I saw a bot submit this code just now:\nn=input().replace('0','')\nprint(sum(1 for i in n if int(n)%int(i)==0))\n\nSo, basically n is replaced by n without zeroes and then this new n is used for the divisibility tests.\n\nA simple test case that would make this code fail would be 510. This code would reduce it to 51 and then say 1 is the answer since only 1 of 1,5 divides 51 evenly. The answer should of course be 2 though, because 1 and 5 divide 510 evenly.\n\nYour current tests with 0's seem to not be able to test for this type of mistake.",

    "content": "Goal\n* I was a bit confused at first because I misread \"count of digits in n\" as \"count of digits of n\". I think it may help by adding a simple example in the statement, e.g.\n\nFor example, when [[n]] is 234, the answer is 2 because 234 is divisible by 2 and 3 but not divisible by 4.\n\nCases\n* Please change Validator 6 so that the input also contains 0 as a digit and the output is also 0, similar to Test 6. (Also note that n = 1 violates the constraint set.)\n\n* Please add a pair of cases where the input does not contain 0 as a digit while the output is 0.\n\n* Please add a pair of cases where the input contains 0 as a digit while the output is not 0.\n\nThanks.",
