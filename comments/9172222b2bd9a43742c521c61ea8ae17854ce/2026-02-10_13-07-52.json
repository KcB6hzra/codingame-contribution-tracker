    "content": "I'm happy to approve this mostly, but my only complaints are that for such a simple clash the statement is very long and the number of test cases is huge, beyond anything I've ever seen on a clash. :P\n\nI don't really see the need for so many test cases, I can't imagine anyone really writing a solution for this that passes 20/38 of these... it seems to me that if your code can solve the ones with only two terms, then it can solve them all.\n\nMy hesitation is just that in Fastest mode, having long statements means that clashers who are less fluent in English will be disadvantaged and sometimes might even just quit when they see the long statement. Then for both Fastest and Reverse mode, having lots of test cases means that you are forced to choose whether to submit early and not bother checking if all of the tests pass, or wait for them all and potentially get beaten by someone who was willing to take the risk. :P",
