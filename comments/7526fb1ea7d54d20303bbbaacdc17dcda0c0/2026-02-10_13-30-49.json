    "content": "Had a very bad time solving this in shortest mode.\n\nTurns out every single input test had a new line at the end and I wasn't removing it (shortest mode). So I was adding the brain---- for '\\n' to the end of my answers. :(((\n\nThis is not fun for debugging, because the in-game \"Found/Expected\" prompts truncate the output and answer with \"...\" so you can't actually fix bugs like this easily in a timed situation. I got 0% (63 char). Added \".chomp\" to my code (69 char) and it works perfectly in IDE.\n\nI have now removed all the annoying newlines from the tests/validators. It's a shortest mode catastrophe, especially for a brainf*ck clash.",
