    "content": "HI lilToshi,\nthanks for your contribution!\nSome thoughts:\n- Wording: in the Goal part: remove 'outputs', you must search strings for capitalized letters,\n  not string outputs. \n- Highlighting in the input part: as it is now it suggests that both N and S are input, but only N is. \n  So I think it should be something like 'An integer \"N\":  the number of strings to process'\n- Wording: still in the input part: the output does not decipher the strings, the code should \n  decipher the strings and output the results",

Link to the other:\nhttps://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/48921be0d618fdf6f4073c26b3e60cee700b5\n\nGoal section\n* Suggest to add \"from that string\" after \"there is no output\".\n\n* Suggest to change \"Input lines\" to \"Each input line\" for the sake of clarity.\n\nInput section\n* Do you mean \"number\" instead of \"digit\"?\n\nOutput section\n* Suggest to add \"in the same order as the input strings\".\n\nConstraints section\n* The upper limit of N is not a realistic reflection of actual test coverage. Suggest to lower it to 10.\n\nCases\n* Suggest to vary N among the cases. Otherwise you may as well not provide N as an input if N is always 5.\n\nThanks.",
