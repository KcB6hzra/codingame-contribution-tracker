    "content": "Well, if you consider the all-slots-filled solution as a legit solution, I think you should consider the no-slots-filled solution also as a legit solution. For example, if N=7, there's no other solution apart from all the holes being filled by centrifuges. Hence, your output=1. So, I feel, 0 holes filled (i.e., no centrifuges loaded) should also be a solution, which would make the requisite output=2.",
