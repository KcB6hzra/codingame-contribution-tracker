    "content": "It is also possible to solve this without GCD. Find the smallest prime p that does not divide N (using a sieve) then return N-p\nAlso, all your N are square-free composite numbers. You may add some test cases with N prime or N having a square factor. Just in case someone comes with a different algorithm than yours (e.g. the one I proposed) that would be wrongly implemented.\nExample : find the smallest p that does not divide N (I intentionally forgot ’prime’). 12=> p=5, returns 7. It works only because 12 is not square-free.",
