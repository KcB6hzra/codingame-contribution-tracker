There's a bit of ambiguity involved reading that chain of \"which may be followed\".\n* I don't think that \"length\" input parameter serves any useful purpose. All CG language stubs are able to parse an arbitrary-length string.\n* but do put a limit on that length in the puzzle constraints\n* the n parameter in the statement text is not the same as the n parameter in the I/O section.\n* if shortest mode is in there: don't make the answers 'true' and 'false', rather some puzzle-themed variant like STAIRCASE and NON-STAIRCASE\n* if reverse mode is in there: group the staircase cases together in the beginning",

Some things to note:\n\n· The ambiguity in the description might have been clarified by the example staircase, which is also part of the statement. I also did some slight rewording, but if it's not clear enough yet, feel free to suggest an alternative.\n· Well, in shortest mode, players should be able to exploit their language's built-in constants as much as they can, so I personally think that {{true}}/{{false}} is fair.\n\nAll other points should have been addressed by my changes; thanks again. :)",

    "content": "- ambiguity: what I was thinking of is the chaining of \"may or may not\". It's not clear that choosing \"no\" stops the chain. In which case numbers such as 13531 could be staircase numbers as well (starts with 1, may be followed by 2, but no; may be (and is) followed by 3, etc).Pushing it even further, numbers such as 1357986421 could be stretched to qualify as well.\n- data point (anecdote) for the example: when I first read it, I only looked at the beginning, and did *not* see that it had to come back down. Most likely because it reaches two-figure numbers, that break the scanning regularity. I'd suggest starting with a short example. But do keep the long one; the transition to multi-digit numbers is never totally obvious in that sort of problem.\n\nOpinion: in shortest mode, coders are indeed entitled to abuse anything they can in the language. But that doesn't mean the problem setters have to select the constants to favor a subset of languages. AFAICT, lowercase true/false tend to favor ruby and JS. \nFWIW, I'm a defender of the language landscape variety and would not approve problems with voluntary flaws.\n\nGood job with the other edits.\n\nOh, side note: what does ℕ⁰ mean to you? I'd guess \"strictly positive naturals\", but I'm not sure that's universal notation. (where I live we'd spell *that* ℕ*)",

    "content": ":JBM's side note answer:\n- First of all, the number should be an index and not an exponent because in this way it means a power set (all function that take a 0 as argument and give a natural number) or a vector with natural number in 0D. (I think 0D doesn't exist, I'm not sure, but it would mean that if 0D exists).\nI guess we can't write it as an indice, so ℕ* is a better way to write it (or you could write it ℕ\\{0} if you really want to keep this notation with the '0').\n- And, it should be 1 as an indice and not 0. It will mean \"natural numbers starting from 1\" not 0.\n\n:Opinion:\nBut just to give my opinion, I really like the idea of this clash, really. You're not that far to the final result, be brave !",
