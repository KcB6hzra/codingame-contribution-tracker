    "content": "I would adjust two test cases, also:\n\n- \"Big numbers\" test is a bit easier to pass than Validator 2, due to smaller numbers; if my code barely passes the test, it could fail the validator. I would change the validator to be the same or easier difficulty compared to its test.\n\n- \"Will it fit?\" has some factors, but the Validator does not; maybe there's a chance someone's code fails when wallpaper is blank? Just in case, I would add some factors to Validator 4. If you want to cover the empty paper too, I would add an extra test just for that.",

Also, would be cool to look for wording optimizations if you get the time - e.g. \n- \"wants to have a wallpaper\" > \"wants a wallpaper\"\n- \"on a sheet of wallpaper given the size of ...\" > \"on a wallpaper of fixed width and height\"\n- \"by a single comma\" > \"by a comma\"\nAlso some typos I noticed:\n- \"[...] consecutive numbers and its prime factors\" > \"and their prime factors\"\n- \"numbers fit on a single they\" > missing \"row\" + comma\n\nGood luck getting it published!",

You may move all of it except the first line to Goal section.\n\n* You may remove the \",\" and \"and\" in between the first three examples. A bullet list may be sufficient for readability.\n\n* You may also remove the full example within there, and instead, add it as a Test of the first pair of cases and add another validator to that pair. The first pair of cases should be simple, so the suggested change will achieve that as well.\n\nStub generator\n* You may need to treat [[number]] as a long instead of an int?\n\nThanks.",

Maybe it's already obvious because of \"consecutive\", but I would define it clearly.\nAnd some grammar and wording:\n- still have to fix the typos above\n- \"added to the wallpaper consecutive\" > \"consecutively\"\n- \"5 won't fix\" > \"5 doesn't fit\"\nDon't forget you can always use Grammarly or some other tool to check language, punctuation, wording and the like.\n\nOn another topic, I just noticed the sieve algo in the proposed solution. That's actually pretty cool (and probably a lot more efficient than my initial code). Good job!",
