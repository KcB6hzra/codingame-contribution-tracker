Adding the info to the example will solve that.",

Normally we do not mention that, and instead, a note is added to ask the player to trim all trailing space characters in each line of output.\n\n* Please explain that the cone always starts with a width of 2, and in each subsequent line, 2 space characters are added between {{/}} and {{\\}} until the width of the cone is [[w]].\n\n* Please explain that the body has a height of [[h]] and a width of [[w]]. The left and right sides of the body are represented by {{|}}, and the middle are filled with space characters.\n\n* Please explain the flames are filled with {{X}} instead of space characters.\n\nInput section\n* Please change w to h, h to w, width to height, and height to width. (I think I followed your original wording and that was actually inconsistent with the stub generator.)\n\nThanks again :)",
