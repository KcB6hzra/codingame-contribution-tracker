    "content": "While solving the puzzle, the following considerations arose:\n* For a lot of assembly instructions (including add and move), the same instruction can be used to represent both signed and unsigned values. For example, \"add ah, 255\" and \"add ah, -1\" are identical once assembled but the resulting overflow would be checked differently (jc vs jo). As such, the valid range for immediate values should probably be changed to a combination of the signed and unsigned ranges (I8: [-2^7, 2^8-1], I16: [-2^15, 2^16 - 1]). This slightly increases the complexity of determining whether an immediate is 8 or 16 bits since an instruction like \"add ax, 65535\" is equivalent to \"add ax, -1\" (65535 = 0xFFFF unsigned and -1 = 0xFF or 0xFFFF signed). Assemblers like NASM will correctly assemble the instruction \"add ax, 65535\" as \"83C0FF\" using an 8-bit immediate value.\n\n* Stripping trailing spaces from the source code is checked by both the test and validation cases but is never mentioned in the description. Not sure if it should be mentioned or if it's fine to skip.\n\n* The overflow test and validator are checking very different things which means people can easily pass all test cases but get stuck with a failing validator. It's probably best to change the overflow validator to be similar to the test and skip the check currently in the overflow validator (see next point).\n\n* The description and \"Overflow validator\" force $ to always be a 16-bit immediate value. However, assemblers seem to allow instructions like \"add al, $\" where the destination register and immediate are both either 8 or 16 bits. Expressions involving $ are always forced to be the same size as the destination register (e.g. ADD R16, I8 is never allowed).\n\n\nMissing tests:\n* The register bl is never used in a validation case and the register ch is never used in a test case.\n\n* ADD ah, I8 is never tested (should check if only al and ax are used for the ADD ACC, IMM format).\n\n* Expressions with nested parenthesis are never tested.\n\n* Hex values ending with h can only start with a digit and not a letter. This is mentioned in the description but never tested.\n\n* Lots of off-by-one edge conditions are never checked (e.g. check -128 and 127 are I8 while -129 and 128 are I16 for ADD).\n\n\nOnce these concerns are addressed and the description is updated slightly more, I'll approve this puzzle contribution.",

It does not refer to the entire machine code instruction as the operands are not included in the opcode.\n\nThe x86 assemblers NASM, MASM, and GAS use the following terminology in their documentation when describing the output format for listing files:\n\"offset\" or \"address\"  |  \"binary code\", \"hex codes\", \"hex output\", \"output\", or \"generated code\"  |  \"source code\" or \"source\"\n\nThe puzzle should use consistent terminology to avoid confusion and aid people who are not familiar with assembly language or assemblers. As such, I recommend changing the output format description to the following (or something similar):\n[[ADDR]] {{|}} [[BINARY CODE]] {{|}} [[SRC CODE]]",

    "content": "Thanks again for your comments.\n\n* Signed & Unsigned values\n\nRegarding signed and unsigned value, I agree with you that the same instruction can managed both and that the overflow flag is used to distinguish cases.\n\nMy solution was indeed having an issue with the point your raised (e.g. add ax, -1). I fixed it. \n\nTo precise the goal and the ranges, I8 range is obviously included in I16 and with signed values this is where it is not so trivial that 0xFFFE is interpreted as 0xFE and so as I8.\n\nSo far, the goal describes:\n\n• An IMM argument by default is unsigned (I16: 0..65535 / I8: 0..255). It is signed (I16: -32768..32767 / I8: -128..127) for ADD.\n\nI could update it to:\n\n• An IMM argument  is either unsigned (I16: 0..65535 / I8: 0..255) or signed (I16: -32768..32767 / I8: -128..127) according to commands. ADD is using signed values which means that going over I8 range is considered as I16 for R16 targets or encoded as I8 for R8 target (e.g. 255 = 0xFF). \n\nwdyt ?\n\n* Stripping trailing spaces\n\nWell I can mention it. Not sure it is a must.\n\n* The overflow test and validator\n\nOk. Update to come.\n\n* The description and \"Overflow validator\" force $ to always be a 16-bit immediate value.\n\nThis was to simplify and especially for next part where labels will be also always considered as I16. Do you think I should update to allow \"add al, $\" ?\n\n* Missing tests:\n\nAgreed. To come soon.\n\nThanks.",

Since 0 can fit in an 8-bit immediate value and does not require a 16-bit immediate, that special format does not apply and the \"add R16, I8\" format is used instead.\n\nWhen using an 8-bit immediate value with a 16-bit register, the immediate value is sign extended before being used.

    "content": "Nice, lots of changes have been made!\n\nAlthough ADD sign-extends immediates that are smaller than the destination, the actual resulting value is handled as both an unsigned and signed number (see https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_5.html for a copy of the official ADD instruction reference). Maybe update it to something like:\n\"An <<IMM>> operand can represent both signed and unsigned values (<<I16>>: [-2^15, 2^16 - 1], <<I8>>: [-2*7, 2^8 - 1]). If the immediate does not match the size of the destination, it will be sign-extended or zero-extended when the instruction is executed, depending on the opcode. Whether the immediate is interpreted as a signed number, an unsigned number, or both depends on the instruction. For example, executing an <<ADD>> instruction will update both the unsigned carry flag and the signed overflow flag.\"\nNot sure how much detail you want in the description. I think it would also be helpful to make a note about the sign extension after the relevant instruction encoding (see below).\n\nOffsets, such as $ and labels, seem to always be encoded using a full-size immediate up to a max of 32 bits (at least by NASM). For example, \"add al, $\" is 8 bits, \"add ax, $\" is 16 bits, in 32-bit mode \"add eax, $\" is 32 bits, and in 64-bit mode \"add rax, $\" is still encoded with a 32-bit immediate. As such, it's probably better to allow instructions like \"add al, $\" and add them to the test cases.\n\n\nFor the test cases, most of the missing cases have been added. The following are new or still missing:\n* \"ADD ah, I8\" is still missing.\n* Add \"mov R16, -32768\" to both test cases.\n* Add 65535 and -128 to the \"Add again\" test.\n* Add 0xff7f and 0xff80 to the \"Add again validator\".\n* The \"Invalid hex number validator\" is more difficult than the test case since it is an expression involving a valid register. Maybe update the test case to be similar (or change to printing all errors instead of only the first and then check both issues).\n\n\nChanges to the description (hopefully everything):\n\n* Intro, 1st paragraph:\n    * \"DOS emulator\" => \"DOS emulators\"\n    * \"enrich your assembly\" => \"enrich your assembler\"?\n    * Not really sure what \"assembler features\" and \"commands\" are referring to or what differentiates them.\n\n* Grammar 3.3: \"character\" => \"character constant\"\n* Grammar 4.3:\n    * \"a character\" => \"a character constant\"\n    * \"{{$}}(<<I16>>)\" => \"{{$}}(always encoded using the same size as the destination register)\"\n    * \"a number result\" => \"a number resulting\"\n* Grammar 4.5: \"define a character\" => \"define a character constant\"\n\n* Commands, 3rd paragraph: \"operand types and the assemble code (Hex codes):\" => \"operand types and corresponding instruction encodings:\"\n* ADD encoding:\n    * Add \"(only if the immediate size matches the register size)\" to the end of the line for the ACC, IMM format?\n    * Add \"(I8 will be sign-extended when executing)\" to the end of the line for the R16, I8 format.",

    "content": "Great, only a few things left.\n\nTest cases look nearly done. Two of the new ones still need to be added to the validators:\n* Add \"add ah, I8\" to \"Add more validator\".\n* Add \"mov R16, -32768\" to \"Mov again\" validator.\nNeed to check that immediates containing offsets are forced to full size:\n* Add \"add ax, $\" and \"add bx, 2*$ + 1\" to \"Add again\" test.\n* Add \"add ax, $ + 2\" and \"add cx, 1 + 4*$\" to \"Add again validator\".\n\n\nLast few description updates (will still fit within the limit with 16 chars to spare):\n\n* Grammar 3.3: \"a character\" => \"character constants\"\n\n* Grammar 4.2: \"<<IMM>> is a numerical value on 16 bits (<<I16>>) or 8 bits (<<I8>>) which\" => \"<<IMM>> is a 16-bit (<<I16>>) or 8-bit (<<I8>>) value which\"\n\n* ADD encoding (move sign-extension note after the only encoding where it applies):\n    * \"(arg2 which is signed for IMM)\" => \"(arg2)\"\n    * Add \"\t(I8 will be sign-extended)\" after the R16, I8 format (with a tab).\n\n* Notes, 3rd bullet: \"it will be sign-extended or zero-extended.\" => \"it will be sign-extended when executed.\" (since zero-extension only seems to be special cases)\n\n* Example: \"2nd part ([[data]]).\" => \"2nd part ([[data]]):\"\n\n* \"Hello\" test case: \"interupt\" => \"interrupt\"\n\n\nNice idea adding some of the explanation to the test case comments (though still size-constrained). Maybe update it slightly as follows:\n\n; Tricky encoding explanation\n;\n; 65535 = 0xFFFF (unsigned)\n; -1 = 0xFFFF (16-bit signed)\n; Two different numbers are encoded the same way\n;   depending on the range considered (signed or unsigned).\n; When executed, instructions will interpret the immediate as\n;   signed, unsigned, or both (ADD/CMP/...).\n; MOV example\nmov ax, 65535   \nmov ax, -1\n; ADD example\n; As 65535 = 0xFFFF = -1 and -1 = 0xFF for 8 bits,\n;   the command is assembled with R16, I8:  83 C0+T data\n; 0xFF will be sign-extended to 0xFFFF when executed.\nadd ax, 65535",

Below are my comments on the updated version.\n\nGoal\n* Paragraph 2: Suggest to change \"display compiled code associated to program line\" to \"display the compiled code next to the program\".\n\n* Grammar point 3.1: Please add \"(also called <<operands>>)\" after \"arguments\". Its definition needs to be shown earlier; currently it is placed AFTER the word first appears in the section \"Error messages\".\n\n* Grammar points 4.2, 4.3 and 4.6 seem to be inconsistent. 4.2 and 4.3 suggest that IMM is a value, but 4.6 suggests that it can be a value or an expression. Should the points be merged or rewritten in some way?\n\n* Grammar point 4.5: Please add \"e.g. {{'a'}}\" after \"a character\".\n\n* Grammar point 4.5: This point seems to be made up of two unrelated points. Should the \"$\" sentence be split out as a separate point?\n\n* Suggest to move the heading <<Error messages>> below Grammar point 4.7.\n\n* Error messages: Please change \"see below:\" to \"e.g.\".\n\n* Suggest to add a heading <<Commands>> below the part of \"Error messages\".\n\n* Please delete \"Command arguments are also called operands.\"\n\n* Please move \"In this first puzzle, we will use 3 commands.\" to the front of \"The following tables describe\".\n\n* Please change \"is using\" to \"needs\".\n\n* Please change \"operands types\" to \"operand types\".\n\n* MOV: Please change \"This command moves the source\" to \"Moves a source\".\n\n* MOV: Please change \"the target\" to \"a target\".\n\n* ADD: Please change \"Add a source value\" to \"Adds a source\".\n\n* ADD: Should \"4+w\" be rewritten as \"04+w\" to be consistent with the way you write \"00+w\"?\n\n* w = 1 / w = 0: Please explain which w to choose if arg1 is R16 and arg2 is R8 or vice versa.\n\n* Please change \"8 * S\" to \"8 * [[S]]\".\n\n* Suggest to add a heading <<Example>> above the simple example.\n\nOutput\n* Suggest to change \"position\" to \"starting position\".\n\n* Please change \"is on\" to \"consists of\".\n\n* Please add \"(uppercase)\" after \"byte codes\".\n\n* Please add \"is\" in front of \"the line\".\n\n* Please \".\" to the end of the last two lines.\n\nCases\n* In the current output, there won't be a space to the left of \"|\" if there are 6 byte codes in OPCODE. See example here:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/4pimk3n\n\n* Separate case on \"$\" pending.\n\nConcepts (you may consider rewriting the statement with reference to the answers to some of the questions below.)\n\n* How is an IMM classified? I16 if the value ≥ 256 (in base 10), otherwise I8?\n\n* Is determining whether AX and AL are considered as ACC relevant to the command ADD only (for the purpose of this puzzle)?\n\n* Is the AH register also a primary accumulator?\n\nI'll go through the statement again after the above points have been addressed and I understand it better.\n\nThanks again.",

I16 if the value ≥ 256 (in base 10), otherwise I8?\n\nIf IMM is used to a direct assignment to R8, it is considered directly as I8 and the range depends on the fact that it is a signed or unsigned byte. So, for unsigned 0..255 and for signed -128..127. \n\nIf used with R16, then by default the unsigned range is considered.\n\n* Is determining whether AX and AL are considered as ACC relevant to the command ADD only (for the purpose of this puzzle)?\n\nYes limited to ADD for this part but it appears in many other commands that will be implemented in next parts.\n\n* Is the AH register also a primary accumulator?\n\nNo. Only AX & AL.",

The other one raises an error.\n\nTo be consistent with overall approach I agree to raise an \"Invalid operand\" error.\n\nI am going to update the solution.",
