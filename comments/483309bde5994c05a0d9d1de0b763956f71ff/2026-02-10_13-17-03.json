    "content": "This statement is terrible!\n\n\"The goal is to check if 2 or more strings are anagrams of each other, which means they contain the same letters but not necessarily in the same order.\"\n\nThis sounds VERY much like the problem is asking us to see if there are \"2 or more\" anagrams among the lists. What you are REALLY asking is \"are ALL of the strings provided anagrams of each other\".\n\nHaving most of your test cases only consist of 2 cases makes this a lot harder to notice in a clash, then you just get stuck on the impossible Large cases and can't understand why you are getting the wrong answers.\n\nYou should edit the statement to clarify that the problem is whether they are ALL anagrams of one another not just \"2 or more\" of them are anagrams... I lost on a clash because I didn't understand what you were asking.",
