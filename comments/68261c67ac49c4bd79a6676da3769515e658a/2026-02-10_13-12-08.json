I struggled a lot more with the validator than I did with the test case, and I was able to create multiple solutions that could pass all test cases, but not Validator 7. I believe this is due to Test 7 having a guess with 3 black clues while the most black clues for any guess is only 2 in Validator 7. Obviously, the black clues are the most valuable information given. I'd like you to consider switching Test 7 with Validator 7.",
