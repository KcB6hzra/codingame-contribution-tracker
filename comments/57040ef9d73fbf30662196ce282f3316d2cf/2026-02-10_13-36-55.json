    "content": "I now have three approvals, but they all took place in different months. The puzzle was barely changed (only the wording), so the approvals aren't of different versions. I believe the reason that it has taken so long to obtain three approvals is because the difficulty of this puzzle is \"hard\". It's reasonable to assume that relatively fewer people actually tried to solve this puzzle for that reason, and thus there is a smaller pool of people who are able to approve it. It therefore makes sense that the approvals are spread out. Personally, I don't see any merit in requiring three approvals in the span of a single month. I have addressed all criticisms, and the overall evaluation appears to be clearly positive (+18). So I think this puzzle is ready to be accepted. What are your thoughts?",
