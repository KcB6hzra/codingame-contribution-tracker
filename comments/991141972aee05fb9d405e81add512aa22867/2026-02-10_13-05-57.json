    "content": "This is nice, and solvable in Reverse in under 5 minutes, but I really think you need another test/validator pair.\n\nCurrently, the test cases are n = 2, 1, -1, 0, 10. Which means that only 2 of the test cases don't give \"Error\" as the result. I think you really need at least one more test case that doesn't give \"Error\" so that clashers will have at least 3 examples to look at to be sure what the puzzle is about.\n\nI suggest a test/validator pair with n = 6 and n = 7, maybe even another with n = 9 and n = 8. \"n = 9\" in particular would help clarify to clashers that the condition for \"Error\" is when n is not between 1 and 9.",
