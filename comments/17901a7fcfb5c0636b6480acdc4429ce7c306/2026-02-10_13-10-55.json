Now realistically, I don't understand how it works, but it makes sense to halve the time if you can cook both sides simultaneously. In order for this to work, p/2 would need to be equal to or greater than n.\n\nHere is an example of what I mean ( where p# is the plate number, s# is steak number, and l equals steak side.)\n\n00:00\np1-s1 p2-s2\n\n01:30\nP1-s1 p2-s2\n\n03:00 (Both s1 and s2 are done)\np1-s3 p2-s3\n\n04:30 (s3 is done)",
