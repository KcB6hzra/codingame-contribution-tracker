I would add something like:\n\"If he doesn't manage to kill them all, output the amount of *extra* time he needed. *If he does manage to kill them all*, output the time he spared by killing them sooner. The impostor starts with the cooldown *on/active*\" \n[Is there a reason for starting in cooldown mode? It doesn't quite fit the story]\n\nI think you should also mention that the killings are instantaneous!",
