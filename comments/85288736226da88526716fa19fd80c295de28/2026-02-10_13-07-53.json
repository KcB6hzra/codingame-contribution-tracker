    "content": "Interesting idea.\n\nGoal\n* Please mention there is no floor {{0}}.\n\nConstraints\n* Please fix the second constraint, as some of the cases violate it.\n\nOther thoughts:\n\nFor Fastest mode it should be relatively straightforward to use either some string functions or a regex to solve the puzzle. For Shortest mode the clash will definitely require much more thought.\n\nTo make the output prettier, you may request the player to right-align both columns and add extra spaces in front of the numbers where necessary, e.g.\n\n(requires monospace formatting)\n```\n100 101\n 98  99\n…\n 11  12\n  9  10\n…\n -1   1\n -3  -2\n…\n-10  -9\n-12 -11\n```\n\nOf course, that additional requirement would add some more time needed to think it out.\n\nThanks.",

For reference the most above ground floors in any building is 163 for the Burj Khalifa and the most underground floors seems to be 12 for the Sydney Opera House.",
