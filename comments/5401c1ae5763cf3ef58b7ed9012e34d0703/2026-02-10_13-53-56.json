    "content": "I did a simple solution which does not \"round up to the next integer\" but instead just uses standard Python's integer division (i. e. floors the float down), but it passed all the cases.\n\nMaybe some corner cases to check for this are needed? What about some discount of 999 * 9 /100 (my Python solution would return 89, but your description would require 90, as far as I understand).\n\nP. S. Oh okay, I think I can dismiss my comment; if this is about ceiling final purchase amount (not the discount), then applying floor on the discount actually works fine! Sorry for disturbance.",

    "content": "TL;DR: Not adapted because:\n- too many different parameters.\n- combination of different operations on a list (sum and max)\n\nWithout instructions, you could understand that parameter 2 is the cardinal of numbers after it.\nGiven the output and already with approximation, you might understand that you need to sum this list. But you must understand that only with first two examples because other examples may be too big for fast mental calculation.\nAfter that, there is nothing to make you to understand that:\n- first parameter is a discount\n- you must apply this discount ONLY to the most expensive price.\nFurthermore, the most logical answer should be to apply the discount to the cheapest price.",
