If we see BABC, we have received one wrong color, but then we received the A that we were looking for, and we continue checking for the next parts of the rainbow, so we see that we have indeed 3 parts that are correct, and 1 which is incorrect (valid character, wrong place).\n\nOf course the fact that you found this unclear means that it's at least a bit confusing, which is not ideal for a quick clash were you should quickly grasp the meaning of the request. So I would like to correct it by adding an example, but I don't think that this is possible.\n\nAltenatevely, I could add it to the body of the clash.\n\n\"\nAll the allowed colors should be present in a rainbow request, in order.\nAllowed colors in the wrong order and not allowed colors are considered illegal characters.\nOnly characters between A and Z are considered colors, everything else is ignored.\n\n\nIf the operator is waiting for an ABC ruled rainbow, and receives a BABC rainbow, the rainbow is invalid! With 1 invalid character.\nB considered a color, and it's read when we are waiting to read an A, so it's incorrect.\n\"\n\nCan you write in a comment which was the original validator/test? So I can see it for myself.\n\nAlso, I don't remember which was the original validator, but isn't this the same case as the validator 2?",
