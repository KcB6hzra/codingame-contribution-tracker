    "content": "Understood what the code may look like if not using a standard library. Thanks. 👍\n\nIf my understanding is correct, it is possible to solve the puzzle without converting the inputs to floats, as shown by your code. While the job may be much easier by using the standard library, the author need not take care to make sure the parsed variables are of the type most convenient to the coder.\n\n**Consistency with the statement is sufficient.**\n\nThat's the main rationale behind my comment on the stub generator.\n\nSome related points:\n\n• In most cases, the author should not prescribe the approach on how to solve the puzzle for the player. (I know that is not your intention.)\n\n• It is easy for the coders to write a few lines of code to convert integers into floats if they want to / if they feel it is necessary. It's their choice.\n\n• Such conversion is not required for ALL languages. I may equally argue that the conversion to floats means (a little bit) more code is needed when formatting the output, as either conversion back to integers or formatting of floats as integers is required.\n\nAt the end of the day, you are fully entitled to make the final decision, and I would respect that. :)",

This puzzle follows the Python conventions for printing complex numbers.\" in Output section. Avoid repetition and keep Output section away from more explanation than necessary. :wink: )",
