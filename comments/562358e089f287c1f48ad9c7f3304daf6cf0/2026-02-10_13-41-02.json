    "content": "Interestingly enough, the current suggested solution relies on a combination of bugs of the platform: As it raises an exception after printing the proper answer, it is considered correct in the IDE but not by the automatic solution checking system. It is then a kind of valid solution that theoretically could not have been accepted by the contribution system, but yet has been, probably because of this other bug https://forum.codingame.com/t/contribution-system-small-improvements/162318/9",

Both of us used the \"tr\" function (that in my opinion seems to be the best tool for this kind of problem), I used Ruby and he/she used Bash.\nI've just checked that the problem is on the last validator, it includes the substring \"S-)\" on the alphabet making \"tr\" raise an exception, as it tries to create a range from \"S\" to \")\".\nMy suggestion is to add a similar substring to the test as well, so people that use the \"tr\" function will notice this corner case.",
