The issues I had with my code in a slow language (ruby) are completely solved, and even if the timings are a bit close (some tests/validators near the ~5sec mark), I ran the full testset 5 times and passed every time*.\n\nAs @Timinator said, it is a very challengling puzzle, probably on the higher end of the hards, but definitely a fun one.\n\n*Now, my solution is deterministic (as I imagine everyone else's will be), so I wonder if other different strategies may still find themselves timeoutted (by a low margin). Other solvers may have to give feedback on that.",

Suggest to rewrite it as follows:\n\nYou have thought about simply ordering only the cheapest type and breaking them down to 1x1 blocks to let you pave any kind of floor. However, that can be risky - a competitor who did so received a lot of complaints from customers when they saw cracks in the blocks! While breaking floor blocks isn't an option, rotating them is perfectly fine.\n\n* Please change \"Some part\" to \"Some parts\".\n\n* Suggest to change \", these are walls, pillars, ...\" to \"by walls, pillars, etc\".\n\n* Suggest to change \"everything else\" to \"everywhere else\".\n\n* Suggest to change \"you can't leave holes\" to \"as you can't leave holes\", and add \"and\" before \"clients\".\n\n* Suggest to change \"filled with\" to \"paved with\".\n\n* Suggest to add \"Width & height =\" before \"7 7\".\n\n* Suggest to add \"Prices of each type of blocks =\" before the prices.\n\n* Suggest to add \"Minimum price to pave the floor =\" before \"96.10\".\n\n* Suggest to add \"The number of each type of blocks to use =\" before \"4 0 0 2 0 0 0\".\n\n* Suggest to add \"Number of ways to pave the floor =\" before \"{{6}}\".\n\nInput\n* Line 1: Please add \"space-separated\".\n\n* Line 2: Please change \"prices\" to \"price\".\n\n* Last description: Please change \"represent\" to \"represents\" (twice).\n\n* Last description: Suggest to change \"fill\" to \"pave\" and \"filled\" to \"occupied\".\n\nOutput\n* Line 1: Suggest to change \"fill\" to \"pave\".\n\n* Line 1: Please change \"precision\" to \"places\".\n\n* Line 2: Suggest to change \"fill\" to \"pave\".\n\n* Line 2: Please add \"separated by a space\".\n\n* Line 3: Suggest to change \"we can use\" to \"to pave the floor with\".\n\nConstraints\n* Please change \"w\" to \"W\" for consistency.\n\n* Please change \"h\" to \"H\" for consistency.\n\n* Please change \"[[Pi]]\" to \"[[P1]] to [[P7]]\" for consistency.\n\nStub generator\n* Please change line 2 to parse 7 floats instead of a string.\n\nCases\n* Pair 12: Those look like swastikas…?\n\nThanks.",
