    "content": "It is now much improved from the original version.\n\nThe interesting part is in the looping to search for seats.\nThe disappointing part is to calculate the per-seat matches. It is really tedious.\nIf there is a way to have a different requirement that checks the successful allocation of seat and at the same time less troublesome in counting, this puzzle will be even better.\n\nApproved.",

I like the theme and the general problem of seat finding but the result seems disappointing. Why should I count groupSuccess and personSuccess?\n\nMy suggestions:\n- use bullet list to explain the different rules of seat finding and group splitting\n- avoid flavour text (orangutan, airport...)\n- remove any information that is not necessary to solve the pb (tickets can be sold to the same seat)\n- consider changing output to %age of happy persons (same pb but easier to describe and perhaps more fun to solve)\n\nIdea for another related puzzle: groups with assigned seats arrive to the cinema. If their seats are taken, they ask the sitting group(s) to find another place. To find another place, a group will sit closest to the center of the room. Calculate how many people have to change place if the first group takes their place in the center. (or how many times people have to change place)",

    "content": "Thanks for the feedback and for your time to solve this candidate puzzle!\n\nMy sample solution also uses the 'dumb' approach. As groups can come in any order, size, place etc, I didn't think the simulation of seat-finding can be really avoided. My intention was not a computational-complexity optimization puzzle, but a simple simulation puzzle. \n\nRegarding bigger cinema: I don't know what is the maximum for input data size. One test case already involves 187 lines of input, can it be /shall it be increased even?\n\nRegarding difficulty setting: I am a bit afraid to put it under easy, as having to split the groups can be tricky (I use a stack of Group objects in my sample solution, but I can imagine to use some recursion as well.)  I think this puzzle needs a bit more effort than most of the current 'easy' ones, and I want to avoid frustration which I seem to have caused with my other, IMHO easier puzzle. But if other puzzle approvers agree, I shall modify it.",
