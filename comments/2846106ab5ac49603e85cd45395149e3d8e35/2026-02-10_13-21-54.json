    "content": "I like this one. It does provide a challenge for clash of code, but it's very possible.\n\nGoal:\n* Try to immediately tell the user that A is an array: \"You want to sort an array A, but you have a problem\".\n* The third sentence: you want to say \"index numbers of A\" instead of \"the index numbers of A\". The latter would mean that B contains all indexes, which means M == N. The former means that SOME index numbers of A are in B, not all of them.\n* The fourth sentence is convoluted, and the content needs to be guessed at from the context. Maybe \"You cannot move the elements of A whose indexes are in B.\" would be a good alternative.\n\nInput:\n* I suggest to not talk about arrays, but instead only tell the user that A and B are space-separated integers.\n\nOutput:\n* Don't talk about arrays, tell the user that the puzzle expects space-separated integers.\n\nAdditional remarks:\n* Maybe it would be a good idea to include tests with N > 10. I don't know how high it should go.",
