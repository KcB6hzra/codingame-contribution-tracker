And the design is nice.\n\nIn fact, I've loved it so much I've wrote a solution which prints nice and shared the puzzle across more than Codingame (https://github.com/BuonOmo/coin-run). Please tell me if this bother you, in that case I'll make it private :)",

From the test cases alone, it's not possible to determine which is correct.",
