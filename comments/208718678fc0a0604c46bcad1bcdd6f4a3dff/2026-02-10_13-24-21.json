Still, I'd check back in the near future and approve it regardless since these comments are extremely minor.\n\nTest cases:\nAccording to the constraints, n can only be less than or equal to 16. However, none of the test cases nor validators actually reach n = 16. Moreover, the length of the color name can only be less than or equal to 100 characters but none of the test cases nor validators actually reach 100 characters for colorName.\n\nYou could have one test case that goes towards these constraints. Since your color names in the current test cases all have proper names, the test case that goes for the constraints of colorName can have arbitrary naming just to reach the limits.",

    "content": "Well, I totally understand your point (the program must still work even if you are given inputs close from the allowed limits).\n\nBut from my point of view, the constraints are not there to trap the players (you have to check these constraints are respected or be sure you still deliver a correct output even if the inputs are close to the limits) but rather to help them (if you want to have a fixed sized array for colors, then you can choose 16 as a size, if the language you are using asks you a maximum size for a string then 100 is an appropriate value).\n\nThis being said, it is easy to add a test case and a validator or to change the constraints so that they match the  test cases.",
