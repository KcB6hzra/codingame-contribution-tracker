Please fix either the case or the constraint.\n\nCases\n* Is it really a good idea to include integers which have leading zeros (e.g. 01, 0000000004, 0040)? This is not mentioned in Goal section (for Fastest/Shortest modes), and also this is covered in validators but not in any tests. In Reverse mode the latter issue can easily frustrate players, because they do not see the validators, and have no idea that they have to deal with such cases.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "I like the idea, its a nice clash. In revers mode it might be a bit too hard.\n\nEverywhere:\n- I was confused by this pipe \"|\" or is it a capital i \"I\". Please use a capital \"L\" as variable name.\n- Don't mix up Element and Integer. For me it feels like there might also be some floats or strings in there.\n\nGoal:\n- \"integers in an integer list\" that sounds like a repetition. Better use: \"integers in a list\"\n\nInput Section:\n- add \"separated by spaces\"\n\nConstrains:\nYour point gets clear. But I would formulate it differently:\nNumber of elements in L <= 100\n0 <= each element <= 100\n\nTests:\n - I didn't expect leading zeros, I'm not sure if these are valid integers. And can they be satisfied with the constrained 0 < l_i < 100 ?\nIf you want to go with leading zeros, there should be at least one test and not only validators with leading zeros.\nI would also mention it in the description: \"The integers may contains leading zeros.\" Or something like that. Instead of the bold INTEGERS.\n\nStub Generator:\n- maybe use \"loopline N element:int\" \n  which will generate:\n  for i in input().split():\n    element = int(i)",
