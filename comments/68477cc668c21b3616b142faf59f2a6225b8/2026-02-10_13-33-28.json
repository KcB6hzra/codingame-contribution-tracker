I don't think selenae's suggestion is too simple for those of us who are unfamiliar, if anything I would include additional easy tests:\n\n1234, 2 > 121\n1234, 3 > 1213121\n1234, 4 > 121312141213121\n\nWith the knowledge from other cases that 1234, 1 > 1 the pattern becomes clear for the unitiated.\nHappy to approve this if you can resolve the reverse issue one way or another :)",
