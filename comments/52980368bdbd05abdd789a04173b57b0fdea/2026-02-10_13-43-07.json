    "content": "The problem looks much better since you added the equations. Even so, I think most of the 15 minutes would be spent trying to figure out how to parse each number (for languages that don't support parsing something like 1+2i into a complex number).\n\nIt's true that it's easy enough to grab (1) and (2) out of 1+2i, but if it's (-35) and (-3), it suddenly becomes much harder. The best I can think of is searching for the last index of either (+) or (-) and then splitting from that index. You could make the problem go much faster by adding spaces around the operand (-5 - 3i), though perhaps it's still okay to stick with the current format.\n\nGrammar-wise, there are several missing \"the\"s:\n* \"The symbol i represents the imaginary unit which is the square root of -1.\"\n* \"The sum of two complex numbers...\"\n* \"The square of a complex number...\"\n* \"If either the real or the imaginary part is 0, it should still be printed.\" (Input and Output sections)\nAlso rewrite: \"For example, the sum of the complex numbers 0+1i, -2-3i, and 4+5i is\"",
