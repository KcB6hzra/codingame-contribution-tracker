Please fix either the description or the cases.\n\nConstraints section\n* Please mention that departure time is always earlier than arrival time.\n\nCases\n* Please rearrange and revise the cases so that each pair of test and validator is similar. For example,\n   • one pair may feature departure and arrival both in AM.\n   • one pair may feature departure and arrival both in PM.\n   • one pair may feature departure in AM and arrival in PM.\n   • one pair may feature departure minutes > arrival minutes (e.g. arrival at XX:32 and departure at YY:12).\n   • one pair may feature departure minutes < arrival minutes (e.g. arrival at XX:12 and departure at YY:32).\n   • one pair may feature departure minutes = arrival minutes (e.g. arrival at XX:12 and departure at YY:12).\n   • one pair may feature depature at 00:XX.\n   • one pair may feature arrival at YY:00.\n   • one pair may feature arrival and departure in the same hour.\n   • one pair may feature arrival and departure in different hours while the trip takes less than 60 minutes.\n\nThanks.",

But if the author does want to add them, use \"length of [[Departure]]\" and \"length of [[Arrival]]\" instead, and also the two variables have to be defined in Input section at the same time. (So adding those two constraints is not that simple.)",
