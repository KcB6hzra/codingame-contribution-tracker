I agree that the sub-grids present a slightly harder challenge than if the sub-grid rule was omitted.\n\nNot sure how I would communicate that there is no need to implement sub-grid checks to the Reverse clashers though. Clashers who do know Sudoku rules might be disadvantaged into trying to implement sub-grid checks. The test cases have been set up such that Sudoku-unaware clashers have a chance to learn the rules (referring especially to tests 5-7).\n\nI had also set this puzzle to be one-pass only to spare clashers from having to implement loops and loop-breaking condition checks, which dilate from the original intent of this puzzle (to test how clashers would implement row-based, column-based, and subgrid-based checks).",

    "content": "Thank you @ejini6969 for your feedback! I agree with @5DN1L that this shouldn't be made into a classic puzzle.\n\nI don't think that writing the code in Python makes the logic any easier to deduce. As others have pointed out, the main difficulty lies in implementing the sub-grid check, which boils down to pinpointing indexes in a 2D array. The \"built-in\" modules in Python (which is simply usage of the hash set data structure in Python) is purely for syntactic sugar, and can be done without.\n\nFWIW, I have also implemented the same code in other languages such as C++ and Javascript which utilise the same hash set data structure. The code looks more verbose, but does the same thing; e.g., in C++:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nstring digits = \"123456789\";\nset<char> digitSet(digits.begin(), digits.end());\n\n// check row\nset<char> row;\nfor (char ch : grid[i]) {\n    if (isdigit(ch)) row.insert(ch);\n}\nif (row.size() == 8) {\n    for (char d: digitSet) {\n        if (!row.count(d)) {\n            grid[i][j] = d;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    continue; // find next empty cell\n}",

    "content": "The main difficulty is just that sub-grids are a lot more time-consuming to define. Rows are easy, columns are a bit harder but still pretty easy. With just rows and columns, you could solve this in around 5-8 minutes. Adding sub-grids is just too much for 5 minutes in my opinion. Like I said, it would probably take me 12 minutes minimum to do all three.\n\nAs for Reverse clashers, I think it would be natural to try just rows and columns first and see if it works before you attempt to solve sub-grids, so I don't think it's such a problem. You could also add a comment to the stub generator to warn Reverse clashers.\n\nHowever, I think the simplest solution is to just remove sub-grids and also remove Reverse mode.",
