    "content": "There's a possible issue with the problem statement.  I don't know how the game is played worldwide, but in every US casino the player always loses on a (hard) score of 22 or more, even if the the dealer (bank) also busts.  \n\nThe en.wikipedia.com article on \"Twenty-One\" games says the same rule applies to both French \"vingt-et-un\" and British \"vingt-un\" work the same way.\n\nI wrote my code that way, too, not reading the statement carefully enough, and it passes all tests and validators.  (I just looked at them here, and indeed--unless I missed something--there is no test case where both the bank and player bust.)  So, if you decide to change the statement to match actual casino rules, no current submissions will be affected.",
