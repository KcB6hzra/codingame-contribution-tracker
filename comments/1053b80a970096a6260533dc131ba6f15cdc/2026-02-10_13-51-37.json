I had it in Shortest mode, I managed to get it down to 82 bytes in python3.",

My original idea was to make performance more crucial (printing the whole progression, up to depth=10), but I soon realized answers with more than 1000 characters weren't allowed. Happy to make it a clash (fastest+shortest) if that's the consensus, would be nice to have another opinion on it.",
