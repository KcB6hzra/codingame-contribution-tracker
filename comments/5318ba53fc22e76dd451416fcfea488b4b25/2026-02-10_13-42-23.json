For each input symbol, it transitions to a new state until all input symbols have been consumed.\", and maybe a link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton\n\nI also think expanding \"allowed final states\" might help: something like \"if the final state is one of [endStates] then the word is valid\"?\n\nMinor spelling (several times): \"seperated\" -> \"separated\"",

See below for my proposition :\n\nInput : \"abc\"\nStates : A B\nstartState : A\nendStates : B\nTransitions :\nA a B\nA c B\nB b A\n\nYou start in state A. The first character found is an 'a'. According to the corresponding transition ( A a B ), you move to state B.\n\nYou are now in state B. The next character found is a 'b'. According to the corresponding transition ( B b A ), you move to state A.\n\nBack in state A. The last character found is a 'c'. According to the corresponding transition ( A c B ), you move to state B again.\n\nThe word is over, the final state is B. This is in the set of the allowed final states (endStates), so the word \"abc\" is valid, and you print \"true\".",
