What to do then?\" - Probably won't be\n\"In what order to display other compatible? What about ties?\" - Stare at a single test with multiple compatible donors for a few minutes to find out how to sort. Ties? Probably won't be\n\"There can be no compatible donor? There can be no donor?\" - if test have edge cases like this maybe there can be ties.\n\nWhen the output can vary so much an explanation would be nice. So having this as a Fastest or Shortest would be better, in my opinion.",

Logic wise, I think it's fine for CoC.",
