Well done!\n\nSome suggestions:\n* Format the variable O in the rules section as a variable. There are two occurences.\n* Clarify that \"... empty cells will be represented by . (a dot) ...\". As it is now, it's a bit hard to see what character is used.\n* Add in the output section that the damage multiplier will be a number with two decimals. I know it's already specified in the task section, but I think it should be in both.\n* Very optional: the section separators (the dashed lines) are not equal in length.\n\nFeel free to bump this to get an approval after looking at the suggestions (and either implementing them or telling me why you won't :) ).",

    "content": "You don't have to pay much attention to the \"context\" part, that's why it's called like that, it's just some lore. A portal is represented by a number, as you can see in the test cases, because the portals are numbered, portal number 1 , portal number 2 etc... so it's just a special location (special location number 1, special location number 2 etc...) on the map/arena/matrix. And then from onward, given the special location from which you will start you just have to construct the route in which the next waypoint is the closest special location from you among all the special locations that you have not yet visited, and to move to that waypoint , and to do that until every special location has been visited, and you have to return the list of these waypoints, in order, and a number computed from the total distance of that route that you constructed. \n\nFor example in test 3. You start from the special location number 1 (because 8 1 is given: map is 8*8 locations and the special location from which you start is numbered \"1\") , so you need to know what special location is closest to special location number 1 and it will be special location number 3 which is 4 cells away in manhattan distance and then the closest special location to special location number 3 which has not yet been visited will be special location number  2 which is 3 cells away in manhattan distance, and then there is only one special location that has not yet been visited which is special location number 4 so that will be the last waypoint of the route and it is 4 cells away in manhattan distance from our current location which was special location number 2. So the route goes \"1 3 2 4\" and the total distance of that route is 4 (going from special location number 1 to special location number 3) + 3 (going from special location number 3 to special location number 2) + 4  (going from special location number 2 to special location number 4) = 11 and if you inject 11 in the given formula the number to return is 1.25+11*0.02= 1.47\nSo you need to return the route: \"1 3 2 4\" and one line below, the number \"1.47\" .",
