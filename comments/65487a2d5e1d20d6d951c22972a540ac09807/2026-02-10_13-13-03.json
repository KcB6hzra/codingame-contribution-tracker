    "content": "Oh I get it now.\n'Take the year in the past that is the same year or earlier if you can't reach it exactly.'\n\nMakes sense now. But I recommend adjusting the description, because it currently says a few misleading things like 'Each jump takes a fixed number of years in inter' which makes it sound like there's only one inter, and 'task is [,,,] in the shortest time possible' (rather than 'least jumps possible')\n\nI've put below an edited Statement I think would help remove some of the confusion. :)\n\nYour time machine is currently at the year [[X]], and you need to travel back in time to the year [[Y]]. However, the time warp technology is experimental and unstable, making it difficult to pinpoint precise destinations. You can only move the number of years in certain given intervals [[inter]].\n\nWrite a program that calculates the minimum number of time jumps required to reach the year [[Y]] from the year [[X]], given the following rules:\n\n- You can perform jumps to previous years only (no traveling into the future).\n- You can only jump back in time in intervals of [[inter]]\n- Your task is to find the most efficient combination of jumps that will get you to the year [[Y]] in the least jumps possible.\n\nNB: If you can't reach the exact [[Y]] date you want, take the value below it that is closest to [[Y]] (i.e. go further back in time if you can't arrive perfectly).",
