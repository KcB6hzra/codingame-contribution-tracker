    "content": "This clash is a bit confusing because of the hit order.\n\nOne of the first lines says \"There will be r rounds, each round **a will hit b** and decrease his health by a_1, b hits a and decreases his health by b_1\", which makes it seem like a will hit b first. But then you later clarify that b actually hits first in the note at the bottom. This confused me in my clash and I was stuck for a bit trying to understand why, since in Fastest mode you often skim over longer statements to save time. It might be good to change that first line around to avoid the misleading implication.\n\nAlso, your code favours \"B\" as the winner in the case of a tie. You specify that there is always a winner, but \"Test 3\" is actually a tie with both on 256 health at the end.",

    "content": "We already have a few \"a hits b, b hits a, who wins?\" Clashes, but this one feels very, very generic, nothing really new, nor challenging. \n\nWe start with a title (with both names I assume?), 1 line of lore, and then a super generic statement. Why not keep the story until the end, and use iornicHealth, iornicAttack, titanicHealth and titanicAttack? because \"a b a_1 and b_1\" are a bit... lazy in my opinion hahah You can also keep the story going with something like \"They both have a life-stealing weapon that recovers half the damage dealt (rounded down) to them\", instead of what feels like \"use this formula on that variable\".\n\nAlso, I think it would add a small layer, if the recovered health was based on the actual damage dealt, instead of just half the attack. So in a case where B have 20 hp left, and A have an attack of 60, the hit is only making 20 damage, so only 10 hp is recovered on A (instead of 30).",
