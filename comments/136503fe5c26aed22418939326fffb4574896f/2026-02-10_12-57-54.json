    "content": "Enjoyed this clash. However, I did not understand the need for the statement \"move them to the end of the track before sorting\". Without doing this step, I still get all correct answers. 5DN1L has already addressed this, but I feel that you should just remove it entirely instead of changing the output of the test cases. Nonetheless, it was still a great puzzle. However, I feel that if you change that one line, this puzzle would make a perfect reverse and shortest clash as well. But still great puzzle!",

    "content": "General\n* The \"move to the end before sorting\" rule has no actual effect in the provided solution. Since all notes (both `fixed_track` and `glitches`) are concatenated and then fully sorted, their original order is lost. Even changing 3 to another integer (e.g. 9999) in your solution produces the same final output.\n\nTo resolve this, either (for both the statement and the solution):\n\n• remove this step entirely, or\n\n• modify the sorting step to apply only to the non-glitched notes, and then prepend or append (depends on what you want) the glitched notes.\n\nTitle & Goal\n* Please use a generic name (e.g. \"Rapper CG\") instead of referencing a specific artist.\n\nGoal\n* Please format \"n\", \"l\", \"m\", \"h\" and \"x\" as {{constants}}.\n\nInput\n* Please replace \"settings\" with \"effects\" to match the wording used in the Goal section.\n\nConstraints\n* Please rewrite the first constraint as:\n1 ≤ length of [[track]] ≤ 100\n\n(Note that 200 is changed to 100 because the longest string contains 37 characters only.)\n\n* Please format \"n\", \"l\", \"m\", \"h\" and \"x\" as {{constants}}.\n\n* Please add \"in [[track]]\" after \"used\".\n\nThanks.",
