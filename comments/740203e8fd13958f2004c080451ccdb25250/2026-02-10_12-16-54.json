    "content": "Your code had two main problems:\n\nFirst, you were buying all three unit types randomly without countering what the enemy was using. The enemy was spamming bowmen, and you weren't using swordsmen which are strong against them.\n\nSecond, you were trying to upgrade and respawn hero at wrong times, wasting gold that should have been spent on more minions. You also attacked from only one direction, making it easy for enemy to defend.\n\nThe fix was simple: spam only swordsmen against their bowmen, attack from 8 different angles, and use hero to distract while minions destroy their base. No upgrades, no fancy timing - just pure numbers and multiple attack routes.",

    "content": "Upon reviewing your code, it became clear that the hero and minion logic leaned heavily on static defense, primarily advancing straight forward without considering multi-directional threats. This predictable pattern left exploitable gaps on the board.\n\nResource management and timing were inconsistent. Attempts to respawn or upgrade without sufficient gold led to missed opportunities and slowed overall progress. Minion deployment and hero targeting lacked coordination, reducing battlefield efficiency and enabling the opponent to dominate key areas.\n\nNevertheless, the underlying strategy had potential. By optimizing upgrade timing, enhancing adaptive targeting, and introducing multi-angle movements, the code could effectively control multiple fronts while maintaining continuous pressure.\n\nThrough iterative adjustments and dynamic strategy application, we were able to turn the tide, applying consistent pressure and capitalizing on weaknesses, which ultimately led to victory. Your code demonstrates strong foundational logic, and with refined resource management and tactical responsiveness, it could operate at a highly competitive, expert level.",

Yellow hero id should be 21 and yellow minion ids should be 23, 25, 27, etc.\n\n- Heroes deal 0 damage when commanded to attack a specific minion\n- Heroes deal unexpected 50% extra damage against minions when given the \"COMMAND -1\" command.\n\n- Vision bug : heroes cannot see neutral mines even within a 100 radius (the bug might also apply to minons and opponent mines)\n\nGreat work anyway, I hope the final version gets published soon !",

E.g if yellow hero id is 21 and his first minion has id 25 then yellow knows that blue has bought 3 minions. The yellow player even gets an advantage because his minions are bought after blue's.\n- Opponent minion ids also give away a lower bound on the number of other minions. E.g blue does not buy minions, then later in the game the blue hero (id: 21) scouts a yellow minion (id: 30). Blue knows that yellow has at least 8 other minions.\n\nMy suggestion:\n- Always give hero ids 99 and 100\n- Give blue minions the id (101 + 2*(random unique number))\n- Give yellow minions the id (102 + 2*(random unique number))",

Instead, explain those constants in a new section.\n\n- Reorder the sections. Bases, Mines, Vision & Range, Economy, and Turn order, should be explained early. Units can be explained after that.",
