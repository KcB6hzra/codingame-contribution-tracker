    "content": "I like this puzzle! A few remarks though:\n\n* Why have your variables uppercase? Wouldn't it be better to have {{n}} and {{shots}} everywhere (goal, input desc, stub generator)?\n* You give the name {{k}} to the output, and have \"write count\" in the stub generator. I'd suggest just having a generic \"write answer\" in the stub generator, or having {{kept_count}} in both (and in the constraints).\n* You have \"which is the lowest between the number of ducks killed and the number of woodcocks killed\" in the output description. Even though it's the answer, doesn't this give it away too easily? How about just having \"An integer representing the number of birds the hunter keeps for himself.\" in the output description?\n* \"Classic No Fails\" doesn't accurately represent the first test set, since \"*\" is not a failure. How about just calling the first one \"Basic\"?\n* Should also probably call the test and related validator the same each time, instead of having generic \"Validator N\"?",

Looking forward to other feedback.\nThanks for the comment!",
