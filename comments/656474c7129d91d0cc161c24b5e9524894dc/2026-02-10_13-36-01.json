Currently you're just relying on Python-specific behavior to handle those edge cases and players reverse engineering that behaviour based on one(!) single test case.",

    "content": "The clash itself is good, imo. It's a useful problem to solve, that I wish I could easily implement on Windows file explorer (:P), I'm sure many would like this once they get it.\n\nThe issue is just that the statement doesn't convey the intent very well.\n\nWhen I read the first sentence in-clash, I thought I was going to have to rearrange the letters and numbers in the filenames. I also thought that \"initial letters\" and \"final digits\" was going to mean that there would be filenames like \"abc111and333.gif\" where I would need to worry about ignoring \"non-initial letters\" and \"non-final digits\":\n\n\"Sort a list of <<filenames>> such that any initial letters are sorted <<alphabetically>> and any final digits are sorted <<numerically>>.\n\nThis places smaller numbers like {{5}} before bigger numbers like {{15}}, then letters {{a}} to {{z}}.\"\n\nI'd suggest changing that to something like:\n\"Sort a list of <<filenames>> in the format <<{letters}{number}.{ext}>>. Sort them by {letters} <<alphabetically>> first, then by {number} <<numerically>> (This places smaller numbers like {{5}} before bigger numbers like {{15}}).\n\n<<Note:>> {letters} or {number} may be missing, but never both. Files with {letters} missing should be sorted above other files.\"\"\n\nFor me, that would improve the statement a lot. Then  I would also suggest removing the \"...\"s from the example, as they are confusing and don't add anything. I'd also maybe add an \"a.gif\" above \"x.gif\", so we can see the alphabetical part in the example.",
