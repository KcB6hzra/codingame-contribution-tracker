    "content": "Just got this in a clash and got very confused and ended up trying to solve a different problem, where there are unlimited rounds until one or both die.\n\nI also didn't have time to include Deathtouch, so I didn't notice that my solution would never give output \"3\".\n\nIt would be good to make it more clear before the note that this \"at the end of combat\" really just means \"after each has had the chance to attack once\".\n\nMaybe also put the \"<<There is only one round>>\" in bold like that? This problem is a lot simpler when you realise there's only one round, but I didn't read the note in my haste to win and ended up with 37%, but came 2nd to a bot who got 75%, but the other human players struggled too. I think if it's clear it's just one chance to attack, it's a lot easier than it looks!",

    "content": "I like the idea but the statement needs some clarification:\n- Do they hit each other at the same time or does the fight end immediately when one of them dies?\n- How does Deathtouch work with 0 strength?\n- If a creature starts with 0 endurance, does it still get to attack?\n- How long does the fight go on? Do they hit each other once, or is it a fight to the death?\n\nI think it would also be nicer to debug if the output was something more meaningful than arbitrarily chosen integer 0/1/2/3. Maybe the remaining health or string \"alive/dead\" for each creature?",
