    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: This exercise is a great problem-solving challenge that requires thinking and creativity. The statement is well worded and clear, making it easier to understand the problem. The description of the steps to resolve the problem is precise and logical.\n\nI particularly like how the exercise simulates the scenario of Billy's meter and the GeForce RTX 3060, which makes it more concrete and interesting. The need to find the minimum number of modifications to restore the counter after Bob's breaks adds an additional dimension to solving the problem.\n\nThe example given is instructive and allows you to better understand the underlying logic. However, for the best learning experience, it would be helpful to see a source code example or solution to practice the concepts covered in the statement.\n\nOverall, it's a great programming exercise that encourages algorithmic thinking and creative problem solving. It also helps reinforce the understanding of tables, loops and programming logic in general.",
