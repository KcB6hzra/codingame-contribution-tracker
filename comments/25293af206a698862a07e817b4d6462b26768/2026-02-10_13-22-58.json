    "content": "The solution used here is deceptively simple: round((2*int(input())**0.5)\n\nIt's a bit hacky because it isn't a formula that can be derived from the mathematics, which would rather be more like:\nmath.ceil((2*b+0.25)**0.5-0.5)\n\nbut since math.ceil(x-0.5) is almost always the same as round(x) (except where x = 0.5), you can get away with:\nround((2*b)+0.25)**0.5)\n\nand then because the +0.25 is such a small adjustment, it never makes any tangible difference in a real problem case, so you can simplify to the form used in the solution:\nround((2*b)**0.5) where b = int(input()).\n\nIt's just a bit discomforting to use an approximation as the official solution, for my tastes. :P But it's very nice for Shortest mode!\n\nFun clash though, either way!",

    "content": "Yes, like I say \"because the +0.25 is such a small adjustment, it never makes any tangible difference in a real problem case\", so it's an approximation that works every time, so I get why you'd argue it's not an approximation, but it still removes parts of the formula for simplification. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's just hard to reverse-engineer the logic from your code because it's hiding some of the formula.\n\nAs I said though, very nice for Shortest mode. :)",
