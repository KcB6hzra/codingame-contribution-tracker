Please revise either/both of them to make them different.\n\n* \"AAAA\" appears in both Test 1 and Test 3. Suggest to change them so that they are different (e.g. vary the lengths).\n\nThanks.",

Don't worry about it if you aren't addressing the reader like what the example does.\n\n* The only other way to show multiple examples all at the same place is to put them in Goal section.\n\nOther comments:\n\nConstraints section\n* Please change \"1 0\" to \"1 ≤\".\n\nCases\n* Please avoid having the same input within the same case or across different cases. For example, there are 2 \"AT\" in Validator 1 and 2 \"AC\" and 3 \"AG\" in Validator 2. Please remove the duplicates from all tests and validators.\n\nThanks.",
