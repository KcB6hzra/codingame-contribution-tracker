    "content": "Please update the test cases so that they test the same concept as the validators. For example, if a validator is checking if the current rank is >N, the associated test should also test that same scenario.  \n\nIf someone is not hardcoding their solution, they shouldn't be able to pass 100% of the tests, but fail the validators. I passed 100% of the tests, but failed the final validator.\n\nIdeally you should have a test/validator for each of the following scenarios to properly test the \"miscounted\" scenarios: \nrank == N + 1\nrank > N + 1\nrank == 0\nrank < 0",
