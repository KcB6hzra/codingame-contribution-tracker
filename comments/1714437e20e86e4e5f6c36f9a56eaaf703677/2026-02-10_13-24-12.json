    "content": "It is technically a checksum, but it is what the title claims, the simplest CRC, 1-bit added to the end (parity bit), with polynomial (x+1) across 2 dimensions. An even simpler form is the xor8 (or longitudinal redundancy check), that adds a parity bit at the end of each 8bit word. They all belong in the greater family of Hamming codes. Maybe I should change the title to that? I felt like adding complexity with a more advanced CRC is unnecessary and defeats the purpose of the CoC.",
