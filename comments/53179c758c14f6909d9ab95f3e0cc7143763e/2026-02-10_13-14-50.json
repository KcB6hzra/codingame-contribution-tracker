    "content": "As others have commented, it is both interesting as well as slightly on the challenging side for a clash. What partly makes it challenging is that there is a lot to read. Maybe you could resolve this by making the example (firs test case) *very easy*: with easy numbers and not yet overlapping sender&receiver. Then a player can choose to read, or get the idea from the example right away. (So, I would propose to also add the $ in the input - it makes the required coding slightly harder but the Example will be so clear that players can start coding right away)\nSomething like:\n2\nBitcoin 25000.00$\nEthereum 5000.00$\n2\nAlice Bob 1.0 Bitcoin\nCharlie Bob 2.0 Ethereum\n-> Alice -25000.00$; Bob 35000.00$; Charlie -10000.00$\n\nThe fact that someone can be both receiver and sender can be discovered in the later test cases, and will make the necessary solution code not much harder, so it is not a big loss to leave that away from the Example in my opinion.",

So, e.g. you may change\n   • line 2 to \"loop numberOfCurrencies read currency:string(20) exchangeRate:float\"\n   • line 4 to \"loop numberOfTransactions read user1:string(20) user2:string(20) amount:float currency:string(20)\"\n\nGeneral\n* More accurately speaking, the output is not really the final balance, as the opening balances are not taken into account in the calculation. The output is just the \"net changes in the balances\". But of course, including the opening balances will mean the clash is even more complex (and it already is). It's easier to think that the current clash assumes the opening balances are zero for everyone (and the users are able to pay out of nothingness, lol).\n\nThanks.",

I normally took them into account.\n\nI join you in your comment \"General\".\nEven with parsed strings in the stub, not having the opening balance can be confusing for players. I'm talking about ending balances, when it comes to net changes in balances.\n\nMaybe it would be better to rewrite the exercice, adding an opening balance, but turning this CoC into an easy Puzzle.\nAn additional idea could be that a user cannot have a negative balance after a transaction.\nIf this case happens, ask to print IMPOSSIBLE (because magic money does not exist in this simulation :))",
