In the worst case you have to go through all the possible combination to answer the question. Whether to record weight per bins is marginal issue. I'm noting this because I spent days trying to figure out how to solve this problem without brute-force.",

I'm ready to put it to Hard if there are more voices tell me to do this.\n\nThe output format is a serial of yes and no. It is a binary sequence that can easily be brute force hacked if the list is too short. By using a count to replace the sequence will reduce its anti-hackability. (People can submit a hundred times by hardcode or random output to bingo.)",
