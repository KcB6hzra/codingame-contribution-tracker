    "content": "I inadvertently removed my previous comment.\n\nLemme explain what I said better maybe, you write:\n\"If Ataria starts near the top of the map and can reach the goal by traveling 15 steps East and 20 steps North, wrapping around to the bottom of the map(..)\"\n\nNow let's voluntarily remove parts of that that aren't relevant to my point, it becomes:\n\"If Ataria can reach the the goal by travelling wrapping around the map.\"\nor even:\n\"If she can wrap around the map.\"\n\nSo... Can she? The statement doesn't state it clearly. It only is clear that 15+20 = 35.\nNow then people will be able to get your meaning I'm sure, I know I did, but unclear statements are pains in my opinion because we get the hang of it quick then spend longer wondering whether we're missing something - because what we think isn't a full match to the statement.\nSo in its current state, this puzzle is a no for me.\nAside from that it's a good one I believe.\nI think it needs coordinates as example in the third paragraph, or to be more clear about what happens, like for example mentioning in a single sentence that she blinks / teleports / appears / wraps around (works) on the other side when she reaches the end of the map on one side.\nCheers",
