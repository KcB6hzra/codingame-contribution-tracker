The statement makes this clear in Fastest/Shortest mode, but the tests make it clear in Reverse too.",

Then in Goal section you'll explain that there are [[M]] + 1 people.\n\nAn ugly way is to have [[N]] as input meaning both the number of people *and* the number of statements, but either the first statement or the last statement is empty.\n\nI myself prefer the first way, but it's up to you.\n\nDifficulty level\n* I don't think it's difficult. A straightforward way is check who is at the front of the line is to check which person is never described as standing behind somebody, and it shouldn't be too difficult to figure that out or to write the code to do just that. One can use a set, as you mentioned in your code, or a dictionary, or even just a list.\n\nThanks.",
