    "content": "Just a little help to make this contribution progress a little bit more.\n\n- I added a stub generator and a valid solution (javascript)\n- I removed the reverse mode since it is quite impossible to find the original rules from the test cases\n- I do not think that we can make all validators different from the test on this puzzle since they will be too different (the total number of test cases that we can cover with this puzzle is limited to 9 + cheater variants. See solution)\n- I do not think that an external link to a video is a good idea for a 5 minute clash. The statement should be clear enough to describe the problem.\n\nDo you think that we can approve it like this?",

(the one in the comments) It could be a great way for people to better understand the problem :)\n\nElse, i think it's a good contribution :)",
