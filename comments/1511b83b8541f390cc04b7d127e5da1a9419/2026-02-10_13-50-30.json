    "content": "I like this (and the other) puzzle. I think the difficulty is perfect.\n\nHowever, I am missing details about the encoding scheme since  you just say \"a group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes\".  I'd have expected strings matching `([0-3]{4})*`, i.e. strings consisting of multiples of 4 consecutive base-4 digits. However, your examples show an uneven amount of digits:\n\"*\" -> \"222\".\nShouldn't this be \"0222\" since \"*\" is \"00101010\" in ASCII?\n\nAlso, I'd vote against  the reverse mode for this puzzle.",

And that's good. CoC should stay an arcade game where the problem is not \"Can I finish it\", but more \"How fast can I finish it\".\n\nFor the length constraint, I saw a lot of CoC where constraints was a very exaggerated upperbound, so I choosed to do the same. I'm not sure if it is a good practice, I'm ready to change it. I Just need a confirmation.",
