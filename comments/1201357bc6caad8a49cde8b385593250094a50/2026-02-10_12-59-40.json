Your logic cleanly avoids triplets and respects the constraints. For future improvements, consider layering in Rule 1 (equal 0s and 1s) as a secondary heuristic — it could speed up convergence in edge cases. Also, really appreciate how readable your code is for an NxN board. Keep it up!",

    "content": "I'm still undecided on your puzzle. I have two more concerns:\n\n1) Because your puzzle is meant to be solved strictly with logic, there is no way to create a test case that makes sure the user's code addresses your 3rd rule of Takuzu. The only way to test the 3rd rule is to have a test case that cannot be solved without guessing.\n\n2) As designed, your test cases do not require any attention to your 1st rule of Takuzu. How do I know that? Your solution does not ever test for equal numbers of 0s and 1s in a line.  Could a test case be designed that really did require the algorithm to use rule #1 to get to a solution? I don't know. If you determine it could be done, then an appropriate test case should be added.\n\nWhat you have right now is not really a Takuzu test suite. It is a test suite that requires an algorithm that ensures no row or column has a sequence of three or more repeating digits. The algorithm does not need to concern itself with any other rules of Takuzu.\n\nMaybe your puzzle shouldn't really be related to Takuzu? Maybe it should just be a logic puzzle, that happens to be a little bit like Takuzu? Could you vary the number of consecutive digits that cause a rules violation in addition to the number of rows/columns?",

I think you have an uphill battle getting this puzzle approved due to it not being unique.\n\nMy suggestion is that you try repositioning this puzzle as a stepping stone for Takuzu Solver:\n\n1 - Reformat all your input/output to match Takuzu Solver.\n2 - Reword your goal statement to match Takuzu Solver as much as possible\n3 - An explanation of how the logic techniques used in this puzzle, combined with a backtracking algorithm, such as Algorithm X, is what is needed to solve the hard version.\n\nObviously, there is nothing in your puzzle that doesn't already exist in Takuzu Solver. If you are going to get this approved, I think you need to sell the community on why an easier \"skill building\" puzzle is good for Takuzu Solver that has only been solved 101 times in 2+ years.\n\nIf it were me, I would reach out to the Takuzu Solver author to get another opinion - probably after doing 1, 2, and 3 above. Without that author's support, I think your chances of approval drop quite a bit.",

    "content": "Thanks for sharing and sorry I missed this comment til now.\n\nI intentionally wanted this puzzle to only rely on one of the rules, which is what would make it an easy stepping stone towards the hard version. Before I realised someone else already had a hard version, I was thinking I'd make a medium version that needs all three rules, but doesn't require any backtracking, then a hard version that requires everything.\n\nI mention in the statement and constraints that you only need rule 2 to solve this, but all answers do conform to all three rules.\n\nIf you go to https://www.binarypuzzle.com/puzzles.php and stick to small, easy puzzles. Just using rule 2 is enough to solve pretty much all of them. So this challenge represents the basic skills needed to start solving Takuzu puzzles, while the hard version represents the skills needed to solve Takuzu of *any* difficulty (up to large, very hard ones).\n\nI would rather keep it related to Takuzu than change it so that it's a different problem. To me, this is Takuzu on \"easy mode\" where the trickier rules aren't needed, because all of the test cases I've given are taken from \"Easy\" examples on that site.",

    "content": "Yes, I didn't know about the 'Takuzu' puzzle because I searched only for 'binary sudoku' when checking. But intiially my idea for this was to make this as the 'Easy' version, then potentially do a medium and hard version later, similar to other puzzles that have increasing difficulty levels (Mars Lander, etc).\n\nPersonally, I think the hard version is really so much harder than this version that they appeal to different levels of coder. I realised when making this that writing code to solve easy puzzles would take a fraction of the time it was going to take me to write code to solve harder puzzles, where you sometimes need to use second-order logic to determine the solution.\n\nI'll make some edits now and reach out to the other author, as you suggest. Thanks.",
