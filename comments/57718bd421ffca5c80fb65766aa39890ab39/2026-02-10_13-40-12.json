    "content": "I would suggest reworking the statement a little.\n\nIt may be confusing who \"the user\" is. Maybe it's better to change it to just \"Output all the words that fit constraints/filters/requests\".\n\n\"If command is-\" lines don't look good. It's better to structure it like a switch-case. Exp:\n`If the command is:\n    'start' - check whether ...\n    'end' - check whether...\n...`\n\nAlso, an example from the statement is practically useless since it repeats information from the first test combined with some Input description. You need to explain how come output is what it is if you want to help people better understand how it works. You can also just erase it since the statement and tests explain everything pretty well already.\n\nValidator 2 needs to have 2 lines in the output.\n\nOtherwise, pretty good.\n\nIf you change anything, please ping me",

    "content": "I quite like the idea.\nI could solve the problem in 5 minutes so I think the difficulty is okay.\nHowever, I have to side with Allis on the issue of 'y'.\nIn English, \"y\" can be either a vowel or a consonant depending on the word.\nAs you have included English words in your test cases, it may be better not to consider \"y\" a vowel at all as I fear this could confuse English speakers. (Remember that validators are not visible during a clash so it wouldn't be possible for the player to check whether y really is a vowel or not)\nAlso I think the statement could use a little rephrasing but overall this is promising clash.",
