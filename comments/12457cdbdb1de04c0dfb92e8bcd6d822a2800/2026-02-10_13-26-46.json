    "content": "Nice clash.\n\nOne thing that's not clear in the statement or constraints is whether overlapping matches on a single line should be counted separately.\ne.g.\nEYE\n5\n5\nEYEYE\nYEYEY\nEYEYE\nYEYEY\nEYEYE\n\nYour code would output \"8\" as the answer here, but if overlapping answers on the same line were allowed, the answer would be \"16\". (https://i.imgur.com/qYQGTIO.png)\n\nI think it's important for clashers to know that such overlaps are not counted and are in fact never going to appear in tests or validators. This helps avoid clashers going overboard to solve a harder problem than intended, or wasting time checking the test cases to see if such things appear since the statement doesn't clarify.",
