    "content": "I suggest to put more emphasis on the fact that there is only one buy and one sell per day, because the problem seems much, much harder when you don't read that line, like I did just now in a Fastest mode clash.\n\nManaged to win anyway, after eventually giving up the full solution and deciding to see if just solving for the best single trade was enough to pass the tests and lucked out that it was the right answer. :)\n\nI suggest putting it in **bold* in rule 2, or even splitting rule 2 up into more rules because there's a lot of important detail hidden in there. Including about fractions of potatoes, which is important to make the clash simpler too. Fun clash overall though. :)",
