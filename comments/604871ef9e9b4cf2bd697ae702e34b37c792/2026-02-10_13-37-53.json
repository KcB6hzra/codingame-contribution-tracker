(I guess we cannot reuse the blacksmith or the stable, and it can simply be seen as a grassland after the first use.)\n\nI may answer those questions myself if I read the proposed solution.

I will also precise that.\n- About the wizard, I think this point is clear enough and comes under \"reading comprehension\". ^^ I mean, you can't cumulate more than one stable's bonus because you can't ride two horses, and  more than one blacksmith's bonus  'cause you can't wear two equipments.
