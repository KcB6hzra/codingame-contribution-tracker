    "content": "Inputs can't be compatible because I have all faces oriented. \nDie in the other problem can \"only\" move on a plane \nwhile in my problem, we can see it as moving in space.\nSo I could use cardinals (WEST, NORTH, SOUTH, EAST), easy to understand.\nBut what about the two extra : TOP, BOTTOM ? Is the plane of the back face the reference ?\n\nAlso, he need only to track the position of the face (WEST, NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, TOP, BOTTOM) and I need to track it's orientation.\n\nAs an example, when he has a face \"TOP\", it can be \"TOP NORTH\", \"TOP EAST\", \"TOP WEST\" or 'TOP SOUTH\" for me.\n\nHe deals with 6 states while I deal with the 24 states.\n\nThat's why the codification is very succinct.\n\nTOP NORTH becomes \"1U\".\n\nAt the end, I find it easier to see the die floating in space and one twisting it around one of the 3 axis than having it rolling one some imaginary planes that are orthogonal.",

    "content": "I don't think it's that different.\n\nAdded complexity: track all faces instead of one. Mitigation: the tracking's the same anyway, just do it for all faces instead of a single one.\nFaces are oriented conceptually, but that doesn't need to be tracked as such by the program.\n\nAdded complexity: spins (top/bottom face rotations). Mitigation option 1: they're not needed (that's my rough opinion). Mitigation option 2: express as spin instead of roll,\n\n\nThe other very similar puzzle that comes to mind is the 2x2x2 Rubik's cube moves one. Yours is quite literally a 1x1x1 Rubik's cube move analog. That notation is standardized as well, whether you use the UFRLDB series or the xyz one.\n\nPS: it's not clear to me what you mean in your output format, expressing an orientation as a face.",

This involves:\n  * what x/y/z actually mean as moves\n  * the fact x' y' z', x2 y2 z2 exist\n  * what UFRLBD actually mean as face positions",
