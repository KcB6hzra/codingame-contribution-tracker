    "content": "Nice idea, but currently the test cases are not well-matched to the validators and the hardest edge cases only occur in Validators 3 and 4.\n\nValidators 3 and 4 are the only tests that ensure clashers recognise that you can give change for $20 as either $10 + $5 or simply 3 x $5. I didn't think of this in my clash, but got 100% on test cases, so submitted it, but then got 85% on Validators. In the end everyone failed besides a bot, so I came 2nd.\n\nIt's a pain to hide the toughest test cases in Validators, because then clashers don't have any way to debug the problem before submitting. If you get 100% on the tests, then you assume you've solved the problem and don't tend to spend time looking for edge cases you may have missed (especially in Fastest mode).\n\nI recommend you swap Validator 3 with Test 3, and/or simply add some extra tests that cover this issue.",

For example, if you know that every test that expects \"Not enough change!\" will have the validator as  \"Not enough change!\" and n is the same for both test and validator then you could just explicitly insert the condition if n==3:print(\"Not enough change!\") and it would work. Therefore, I think it's best to have at least one of n or the output different for tests and validators.",
