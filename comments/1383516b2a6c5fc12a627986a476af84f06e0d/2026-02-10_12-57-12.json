Thanks for including the MOVE operation :)\n\nI have one main concern, namely, that the first rule applied to two files marked BY_CONTENT is: \"two lines are considered the same if their contents are identical, regardless of their line numbers.\" This seems to conflict directly with the premise of the MOVE operation, since a MOVE operation depends on two lines with equal content but different line numbers.\n\nIt seems that I had missed this the first time round. Perhaps this wasn't meant to be an edge case to be handled, but rather, a misunderstanding of the text diff tool rules previously. What do you think?",

So you can have a move operation when a line has same text content but is not at the same place in the revised file.\n\nIn the opposite, its not possible to get MOVE operation when configuration is set BY_NUMBER. Because you identify an instance of a line by its position inside the file. So lines at different positions will never be considered the same instance in such case.",
