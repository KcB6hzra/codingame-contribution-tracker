    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: Approved since the question is cool! :)\n\n\"the position of the numbers is flipped\" - I understood this as position of digits within a number for example 18 become 81.\nMaybe \"the position of both numbers in the equation are flipped\" would make it more intuitive? But yeah it can be figured out since you've already given an example \"18 + 17\" to \"21 + 81\" which shows both numbers flipping.\nI think a subtraction or division example may be more insightful than an addition example up front.\n\nIt took me 10 mins to solve though, not less than 5 like the approval checklist, mainly because of needing to remove leading zeros.\n\nJust another way to solve: I used string replacement instead of converting chars to ints and back, and eval in python3.",

    "content": "I liked this challenge but it took me over 15 minutes in JavaScript. (I think this is the second time I ran out of time in over 100 Clashes.) I would have been able to do it a fair amount faster in Python. People using other languages like C, Go, or Java might need more than 15 minutes too. Maybe you could make it slightly easier by:\n1. Getting rid of the trailing zeroes in #2 and #4 which become leading zeroes when upside down. 0027 != 27 in some languages. (I used `eval` to save keystrokes.)\n2. Getting rid of division and maybe even subtraction to reduce keystrokes.\nJust my 2c, it's up to you. I like this challenge other than running out of time.",
