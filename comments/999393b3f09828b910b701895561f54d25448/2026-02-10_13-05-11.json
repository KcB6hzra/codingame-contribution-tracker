    "content": "Nice clash, it's pretty easy to solve once you get the idea. I think it would be fun in Shortest mode.\n\nAs for Reverse mode, I think I agree with Nekomancer60 here. I tried it under Reverse conditions and was able to solve it, but I really think that seeing the name of the contribution helped me a lot, and Reverse clashers won't see this in-clash. The only test case that really helped me was the '2048' one where a single character appeared.\n\nIf you want this to work for Reverse, I think you need more tests that have a single character, because those are the ones that could really make it clear to the clasher what is happening. But I guess in the 2048 game, you usually start with 2 tiles and it's rare to get down to one...\n\nI'm not sure the best way to go about it, but without some clearer tests, I think this is asking a bit much of clashers in Reverse mode, especially if they've never played the game before.",
