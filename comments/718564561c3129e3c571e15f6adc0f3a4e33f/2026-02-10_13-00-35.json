    "content": "Nice puzzle idea.\n\nThis will be good, but I think I've found a few edits that would improve it.\n\nThe input format for [[scores1|2]] is a bit complicated and not explained very well. The first line \"a string scores1, a sorted list of timestamps when the first team scored a try, converted a try, scored a penalty and scored a dropped goal\", makes it sound like it's one list.\nReally, it's four space-separated lists of integer timestamps, with the four lists separated by commas. Maybe you could write:\n\na string [[scores1]], 4 lists of space-separated timestamps for when the first team scored: a try, a conversion, a penalty, and a dropped goal. The four lists are comma-separated and any of them may be empty. Timestamps are integers.\n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure your solution and answers are counting the minutes wrong according to your statement. Your code goes from t = 1 to 80, but because you increase the scores at the start of your loop and then immediately add minutes to the adv. time of whoever is leading, you are essentially 'paying them in advance' for the minute that has just started, But that means that by starting with t += 1 at the start of your loop that you've skipped the minute from 0:00-> 1:00 and are instead including the minute from 80:00->81:00.\n\nYou can see this most clearly in the Scotland Romania test, since and Scotland first takes the lead at 9:00 and then never loses it. This means there were only 9 minutes out of 80 where it didn't have the advantage, so they should have 71 minutes of advantage time, but your solution gives 72 instead.\n\nIf you fix these issues, I'd be happy to approve.",

I fixed the statement for the input format, it's much clearer now.\nWhen a goal is scored at the first second of a match (00:01), it's in the first minute (1'), this is why I chose to write \"Consider that the points are scored at the first second of a minute.\" That means that if a team scores during the first minute, they have the advantage during this minute. It can be a bit weird because during 1', the timer is 00:xx, but I don't think this is a big problem.\nThat's why in the Scotland Romania test, they have the lead during 72 minutes, because they scored it during 9', at 08:00\nDo you think this is too complicated and should be changed ?",

If you want to keep it that way, I think it's best not to call them timestamps or at least add an explanation that a timestamp of 'n' means you should consider the point was scored at (n-1):00.  But personally, I think it would be clearer the other way. But as long as you add a clear explanation then either can work.",
