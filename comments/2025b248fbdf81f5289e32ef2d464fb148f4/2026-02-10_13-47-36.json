If you want to do it in 2 directions, Is there recommandation to start for example by the largest size then the other one? one after each other until you reach your expected size ? Or it doesn't have any impact (for me there is an impact because the lowest energy path will be different for example vertically if you already scaled horizontally) ?",

Maybe keep constraints and definitions on separate lines?\n\nAnyway, it's good to go as is, approving.",
