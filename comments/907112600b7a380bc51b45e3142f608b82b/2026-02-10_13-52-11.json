    "content": "Hi, \nI like this one but I feel there is a missed opportunity to use an even bigger test cases and force more optimizations. Currently it doesn't even have a 100*100 case.\n\nI know the input size limitation doesn't leave much room to grow with the current format, and I am thinking of other input formats as alternatives, like RLE, base64 or base95 with no separators, using bits to represent -1 and 1 as even grids filled with just those two numbers are still interesting, or some combination of these. Anyway, I see how these overcomplicate handling the input so I guess it is best to leave this one as it is and possibly add another version with the more complicated input.\n\nBut on this topic, have you tested your own solution with bigger cases? In JS for example even just 200x200 seems to get too big with your current N^4 approach.\n\nDo you have some ideas of possible further optimizations? There is a N^3 solution.\nCan you solve the 1-dimensional version in linear time?\n\n(Regardless of the above, I'll add my approval to this version after I find some time to test my solution, if someone else does not beat me to it)\n(EDIT: Done, 14 lines of JS and just 3 nested loops)\n(I wonder if these comments will even be accessible after the puzzle is approved...)",
