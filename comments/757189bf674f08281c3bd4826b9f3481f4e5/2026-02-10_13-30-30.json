    "content": "This problem is ambiguous. Take the string \"aabba\". If I remove \"bb\" first, I then have to remove all three a's and get the empty string: \"\". If I remove the first two a's then the two b's, I'm left with one a: \"a\".\n\nYou can resolve this ambiguity by saying you only remove the left-most boring substring each time.\n\nAlternatively (and I prefer this), you can say that a boring string is made of an *even number* of a single repeated character.",

    "content": "In that case, you need to add more test cases. Currently, all can be solved by only removing the first boring substring each time. (To show this, change your regex from \"/(.)\\1+/g\" to \"/(.)\\1+/\" and see that it passes all tests when it should not)\n\nAdding example 2 (baabba) as a test case would suffice.\n\nI would also disable the Reverse game mode since it could be too confusing.
