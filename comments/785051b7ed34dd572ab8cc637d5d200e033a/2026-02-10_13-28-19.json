The main changes are:\n\n1. revising the explanation of the length calculation: \"the left\" is used by the author to refer to the left of the road and the left of the vehicle, which I find confusing, so I have changed it as \"the entrance\" and add an ASCII art illustration for that.\n\n2. revising the description of input line 1: should be number of sets of sensor data instead of length of road (please note that they are different).\n\n3. moving the most of the \"constraints\" out of the Constraints section to other more appropriate sections.",

I think you should better give a line from the solution:\n1011\nAnd compare them to a visualization on the vehicle:\n1-----0\n|-----|\n1-----1\nTo make this more understandable.\nAlso better explain why the solution for the first example is 20L, 27R, 28R. I see you somehow substract the car length from the index of the input so this needs more clarification.",

    "content": "I like the idea.\n\nI don't think that you can add an image, or at least I never saw a puzzle with images included. I was trying to understand the puzzle without the pictures, and it was difficult, but not impossible.  I had to figure out from the examples that you are starting from a closed space (garage?), and the empty calibration space on the left is at the exit. Also it should be described in the text that the sensors are pointing sideways. (although can be guessed)\n\nRegarding the output. The examples should be clearly qualified as examples. Also the output must be deterministic, so you should define the order of the parking spaces in the output. I guess primarily it increases by the index, but you must define the order of the sides. You should declare that the parking space indexing starts with 0. \n\nSince the topic was about vehicle simulation, I could not help but first imagined the vehicle movement continous and the sensors as pointy things at the edge of rectangles. If you cannot add pictures, then the grid nature of the sensors and the movement should be clear.\n\nI think the challenge would be even more interesting, if there would not be a calibration space, but a max vehicle size limited by the puzzle description.",

In these pictures, I gave information about the location of the sensors, the scenario and indexing. I tried to simplify them instead of explaining them in long sentences. But it looks like I'll expand the description if I can't include the images.\n\nWhile designing the levels, I paid attention that the parking spaces on both sides are not in the same index. I will add this to description.\n\nI will update the description with your suggestions.\n\nCould you more explain your scenario?",
