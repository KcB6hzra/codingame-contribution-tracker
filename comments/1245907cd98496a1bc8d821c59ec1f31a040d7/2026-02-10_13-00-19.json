    "content": "Title / Cover picture / Goal\n* The mention of \"Redis\" and \"in-memory\" in the problem statement isn’t necessary, as the task focuses purely on implementing basic key–value store behaviour without involving persistence, performance, or Redis-specific features. These terms might mislead solvers into thinking they need to replicate Redis internals or optimise for memory. Instead, consider framing the task simply as implementing a basic key–value store that supports a few commands. This keeps the focus on the functional requirements and avoids unnecessary assumptions.\n\nGoal\n* Please change \"No thing\" to \"Nothing\".\n\n* Please mention what happens when the same key is set more than once.\n\n* Please format \"null\", \"true\" and \"false\" as a {{constants}}.\n\n* For the \"KEY\" command:\n  • Please mention the order keys should be printed.\n  • Please mention what should be printed when no keys have been set.\n\n* Please mention that the output should be space-separated for <<GET>>, <<EXISTS>> and <<KEYS>>.\n\nInput\n* Please format \"N\" (in \"Next N lines\") as a [[variable]].\n\n* Please format \"Line 1\" and \"Next N lines\" in <<bold>>.\n\nConstraints\n* \"[[Keys]]\" and \"[[Values]]\" are not defined anywhere. Please change \"[[Keys]] and [[Values]]\" to \"Keys and values in [[S]]\".\n\n* Please add \"or {{=}}\" after \"spaces\".\n\n* Please swap the order of the two constraints.\n\nCases\n* Please add cases to feature the EXISTS instruction.\n\n* Please add comprehensive cases where the following all happen in a single case:\n  • SET to assign multiple keys, including:\n      - keys that are equal to their values and keys that are not\n      - duplicate keys in the same command\n  • GET to request both existing and non-existent keys, in a different order from how they were set\n  • KEYS\n  • EXISTS to check both existing and non-existent keys, again in varied order\n  • More SET, including:\n      - Some for new keys, some overwriting existing keys (including those that originally were equal to their values)\n      - duplicate keys in the same command\n  • GET again, the same as last time\n  • KEYS again\n  • EXISTS again, the same as last time\n\nThanks.",
