    "content": "Completely rewritten/rearranged the text.\n\n1. Spent some time trying to implement a tree / graph... and eventually discarding all different ideas and use mainly loops and string operations in solving the puzzle. I'd like to know if there are any cases where a graph must be used to solve.\n\n2. Removed \"You can assume 1 ≤ N ≤ 10.\" from input section. The same has been mentioned in constraints section.\n\n3. Changed in the constraints section: lower limit of M is 0 instead of 1.\n\n4. The author please refer to the guidelines on how inputs and outputs should be written. (In case you don't know, the guidelines can be found by clicking the question marks next to the section headings.)\n\nYour original version copied here for your reference:\nAn integer [[N]], followed by [[N]] variables in lexicographical order, followed by the number of equations [[M]], followed by [[M]] equations.\nPrint in lexicographical order of the variables the general solution of the system.\n\n5. The author please always give meaningful names to test cases and validators. I've renamed them all, though I'm not satisfied with the last two pairs.\n\n6. Revised some test cases/validators for a bit more variety/complexity.\n\n(a) Example validator\nOriginal version:\nc = f ( a b )\nb = h ( a )\n\n(b) Self-reference test case\nOriginal version:\nx = f ( x )\n\n(c) Self-reference validator\nOriginal version:\nx = f ( x )\ny = f ( z )\n\n7. Revised certain functions' names because they violate the constraint that each function contains the same number of arguments. Also revised a 3-letter variable name to 2-letter.\n\n8. If a variable never appears in the left side of the equations, \"variable -> variable\" should be output.\n\nBut for No equations test case/validator, the logic is weird. If there are 0 equations as input, there should be 0 solution?\n\nWill still approve despite point 8, but I hope there's some way to resolve the issue or provide a satisfactory explanation.",
