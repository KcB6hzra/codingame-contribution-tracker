    "content": "Nice clash, but Validator 7 here is a really hard edge case that's not tested in the test cases. It's annoying cos you get 100% on tests, then 85% on submission if you can't deal with it.\n\nThe issue is that early on you get 1581**-2, which in Ruby evaluates to \"4.0007025233631027e-07\", which is the only time that scientific notation ends up coming into the tests. It's really hard to manage this using Regex, even in the IDE, let alone when you don't know it's going to come up in a validator. It would be good to either simplify Validator 7 to remove this, or add a test case that has a similar issue, so clashers can debug in-clash.",

But the problem is that I only call .to_i at the end, the scientific notation comes up before the remaining operations are resolved, so my Regex needed to account for the fact that \"e-07\" can be part of a float in order to parse the sub-equations for solving left-to-right. I'd assumed that numbers should always look like /-?\\d+\\.?\\d*/, but to account for that validator I ended up needing something much for complicated.\n\nHaha, I'm flattered. ^_^ I really have my win streaks broken quite a lot honestly (*side-eyes comp0zr*), but I ended up coming last in that clash, so it was painful as you thought, haha. In the end it was my fault for relying on RegEx for a calculation based challenge. It works well for similar clashes where the input is a single equation you have to solve left-to-right, but since you give the operands as an array here, RegEx was not really a smart way to solve it.",
