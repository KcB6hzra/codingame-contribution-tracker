I recommend disabling Reverse.",

Getting the rules (passing the first 6 tests/validators) is very doable, but getting code to not time out on 7 and especially 8 takes more work than most clashes.\nMaybe consider changing the constraint on n? That feels like a bit of a cheat, but not sure what else to suggest.",
