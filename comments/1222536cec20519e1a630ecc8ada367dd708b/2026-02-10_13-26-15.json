    "content": "1. Does hitting the ship means hitting ANY ONE of the three cells occupied by the ship? Maybe you have to clarify. (I guess if all three cells have to be hit then that will be called hitting and sinking the ship...)\n2. Is it necessary for the player to know the rules of the battleship game in order to solve the clash? If so, you have to state them in the statement as well.\n3. I think it is better to give an example in the statement, because it is not apparent e.g. why 8 is the answer if the board size is 5 x 5. And I guess giving an example still doesn't give away an obvious solution to the clash.",
