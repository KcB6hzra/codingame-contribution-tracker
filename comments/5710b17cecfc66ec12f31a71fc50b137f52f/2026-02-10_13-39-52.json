    "content": "The definition of \"recognizable\" maybe a little bit confusing since the brain kinda skips \"in every 3x3 area\". I would suggest putting this part further so it's something like \"A character is recognizable if there is no 3x3 area in which a number of differences from the matrix of X is bigger than 1.\" I would also like an example but that may be a little too much. Figuring out is a fun process too, not for everyone tho.\n\nThe real reason why I can't approve this is the output format.\nIf it's Shortest I would not recommend using 'true'/'false or 'True'/'False' since it favors one language over another.\nOf course, not everything needs to be balanced but here you can just change it to 'recognizable'/'not recognizable' or 'Recognizable'/'Not recognizable'. It'll not only save some salt but will also enable tricks like `${r?`Not r`:`R`}ecognizable`.",
