    "content": "Optimising this is so much fun.\n\nThe 4x4x4 fits perfectly in a 64bit bitmap which is always nice.  There's plenty of scope for the use of LUTs and you can remove most of the conditional execution fairly easily too.\n\nDefinitely worth optimising further even after it passes the validators because there's just SO MUCH crazy optimisation you can do with it.\n\nI didn't really understand the need for the \"doubly linked chain\" part of the description, although I suppose it may tempt a few people to try a MITM approach which would be an interesting diversion.\n\nHad a lot of fun with this one in C and in Assembler\n\nGreat puzzle!  Thanks Masterglob.",

    "content": "The puzzle is really great. I've lost 2 days writing solutions in Python and Java.\nI'll happily approve it, but first I would like your response on two matters.\n\nFirst, I think it's a good to warn that this puzzle is hard - especially  the hardness is not in encoding but really  in performance!  And brute won't work, you have to exploit symmetries etc. But that's minor and depends of how you will handle:\n\nSecond - I would strongly suggest swapping test 4 and validator 4. \nHonestly, the validator 4 is the only thing that matters, I have a solution that can enumerate all test 4 solutions and sometimes fail to find any validator 4 one. \nThus it is not in any means corresponding to its test.\nAs it will be posted as a blackbox, the users will have no idea that the problem is in optimization. And more optimization. And more. And you cannot test this in IDE, you have to submit. And still red. Fill the pain you miserable human.\n\nReally, putting validator 4 as test 4 will do much good.",

    "content": "Great puzzle!\n\nI've fixed a few minor spelling, grammar and presentation issues.  I've also applied the following bolder changes, that I'm listing here so you can more easily revert them if you don't agree with them:\n- replaced First and Last in the visual examples with Starting and Ending, so as to avoid confusion with the F and L directions later on\n- renamed variable SIZE to N.  Since it comes up all over the formulas, I think it helps readability.\n- moved to 1-indexed coordinates.  Since they're not involved in I/O, it doesn't change the problem, and it helps readability as well.\n\nAnd I'm approving!  Thank you for your contribution.",
