I know roller coaster usually allow one train of cars rolling on the rail to avoid crash. For some slow rides with little risk of crash there are more cars moving in queue. Unsure what kind of ride it is, but it should be irrelevant. Anyway I was at lost when I am asked to find a number on a car to output.\n\nI would say when the first ride is full, I'll sit in the second ride, or the third ride. I guess it is what you mean? Now you should know how to describe the output without adding a language puzzle.\n\n- difficulty level: I feel it is easy after unlocking the puzzle of language. Skills needed are just loops, conditions and bits of string processing. I don't care too much about level setting though.\n\n- will there be a situation I am alone in queue and have no chance to play?",
