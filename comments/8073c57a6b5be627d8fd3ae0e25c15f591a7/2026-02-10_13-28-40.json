    "content": "I think the \"divide\" operation can be described better? Since the rest of the statement only mentions \"divide N by 2\", I first understood the entire operation as \"return math.ceil (N/2)\", but it seems to be something like \"if (N%2==0) {return N/2;} else{ return N-1;}\" instead.\nPerhaps labeling the two operation as \"Operation A\" and \"Operation B\", and then stating \"However, you only can execute 'operation A' a maximum of A times\" will result in a clearer statement.",
