    "content": "This is a very nice variation of the Caesar cipher problem.  I am hesitant about the Reverse version as I think this variation (by word length) might be difficult to derive from the answers alone and still leave time to code the solution. The variation does add some complexity which takes a bit of additional time to code.  The statement is clear and the test cases are solid, covering all the bases.  \n\n* Remove Reverse and I will approve this Clash.",

    "content": "Nice clash! From trying it in IDE I got the following questions:\n- In your description you only use uppercase, and indeed I found out all is with uppercase - but it is nowhere actually mentioned. You can include in the description (maybe in constraint section) that only uppercase is used.\n- At no place is actually mentioned that encode means shifting forward. It follows from your example, but during the clash I started wondering, because both DECODE and ENCODE are required, so technically your example could be for DECODE or ENCODE as well. In my opinion, this would already be solved if you change 'For example, the message CLASH OF CODE becomes...' into 'For example, ENCODING the message CLASH OF CODE results in ...'",

    "content": "Hi ndevfr\nI really like this challenge. I can already sense the satisfaction I will feel when finding the patter in reverse. It will be excellent.\n\nI think that in stead of using the wording 'go back to  \"A\" if we need to go beyond \"Z\".' maybe you should use the wording \"if we need to go beyond \"Z\" we wrap around to \"A\"'. I think it will be clearer as you don't need to stop and think if the \"go back\" is important when reading quickly.\n\n For reverse it might be good with a test case for ABACUS. Your first thought will be Caesar cipher and I think FGFIAY will help since you see the two As both become F and B becomes G. It is easy to see that both are 6 steps up. Then you have an easy check with C.\n\nMake the C in Cipher in Goal lower case.",

    "content": "Two suggestions for ease of reading when doing \"Fastest\", I found the info in description, but only after failing test cases.\n- More explicit mention of direction in which letters are shifted. I misread that they shift to the left because of \"For each letter, we will go back...\" and we'll read it yet quicker in the actual \"Fastest\" clash.\n- Better to add in Constraints section that words consist only of \"english capital letters\", it took me a while to find it in the description of input. Wondered if small letters were after capitals as in ASCII or if we were supposed to convert input to upper case. Had to guess that there is no \".!?\" marks.\n\n11 minutes is what it did take me to solve it, because I've read description too inattentively first. The puzzle is good for Clash. I am curious how long it takes for others.",
