    "content": "Goal / Input / Output\n* Both the terms \"clue\" (a hint that leads you to something) and \"evidence\" (information to support a claim) are used. Suggest to be consistent and stick with the word \"clue\", since you've used [[clues]] as the variable name.\n\nGoal\n* Please explain what the [[clue]] string means (one sentence should be enough). For example, does \"MadameTurquoise (MT) noose readingroom\" mean:\n  (a) MT's favourite weapon the noose is found in the readingroom?\n  (b) MT was seen holding the noose walking past the readingroom?\n  (c) MT's fingerprints are found on the noose which is found outside the readingroom?\n  (d) Or a mix of some of the above?\n  (e) Or none of the above?\n  (Of course some of the above are impossible, but the statement leaves room for me to interpret.)\n\n* The phrase \"Exactly one\" is repeated multiple times, but I'm not sure why that's emphasised. I think most people would assume all [[clues]] given in input are distinct. Can the phrase be removed?\n\n* Is the conclusion in the example incorrect? If the last clue means ReverandCrimson was seen holding a sword in the bedchamber, and the bedchamber is the crime scene, then the culprit should be ReverandCrimson?\n\nConstraints\n* N should be at least 2? Or else the player will be expected to handle cases of a single culprit and no other clues.\n\nCases\n* Pending.\n\nTitle\n* May I ask why you are adding \"[DIFFICULTY LEVEL]\" to recent new contributions? Will the difficulty level be removed from the title of a contribution after its approval?\n\nThanks.",
