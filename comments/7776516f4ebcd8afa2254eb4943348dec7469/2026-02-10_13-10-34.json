However, I've added your two examples as test cases as well, so it should be even clearer, I think.\n\nAs for the description of the triplicate number, that's why I've bolded \"three consecutive identical digits\". You cannot remove four digits. I've clarified the description a bit with \"exactly\" part.\n\nAs for your example, 333333333 is indeed a triplicate number, with 3 removals, as you've said \"three at a time\".\n\nThe number of removals does not indicate whether a number is triplicate.\nHowever, the existence of 3 consecutive identical digits may.\nTherefore, 333444 and even 334443 are also triplicate numbers, with 2 removals.",

Along those 7 cases, you have 3 different variables that you have to find (triplicate or not, how many removals, invalid or not). That is not a lot of cases per variable in my opinion.",

If it contains letters or is negative it's -1.\n\nThe 5 other ones give a hint for the removal count. The players should be able to immediately identify 3 consecutive identical digits and notice that the removal count is greater than 0 in that case. 122555211, 9990 and 333444 will surely steer the player in that direction.\n\nAs for the isTriplicate number, I think it's clear that it's either 0 or 1, based on the provided test cases. Plus there are 2 for 0 and 3 for 1. \n\nI can add another test case, similar to the first one, if you think that would be clearer. I am, however, a bit worried about the number of test cases needed to run.\n\nIn my defense, I've seen a couple of brain teasers in reverse mode like this. I like them for the 2 types of wins: figuring out the problem behind and figuring out the code. :D",

    "content": "Let me state the obvious: I'm sharing my opinion here, and it's your clash, so you decide (and hopefully get three approvers :-)). But, in my opinion, it might help if:\n- You put all triplicate number cases together\n- You add one or two cases with longer triplicate numbers (part of the difficulty is that the second value is very much in the same range as the first. One case with for example 333999111222888777 and another with 446611223332164 will bring the second value a bit higher, so that the distinction between the first and second value becomes more easy to recognize)\n- The later cases shift to not triplicate, and finally not valid.\n\nI agree with your two reasons of liking a challenging reverse. However, in relation to the second reason, a defense for including longer triplicate number cases: I'd like my code to also do a 1 5 or even a 1 10 after I proudly have written it.",
