(Similarly, when introducing Part 3, you could start by noting that the rules are the same as in Part 2, except for the additions, e.g. breakable blockers and tunnels.)\n\n* (Part 2) Please add a placeholder for the link to Part 1 (and likewise a link to Part 2 for Part 3), and update them once the links are available.\n\nRules\n* (Both Part 1 and Part 2) Please change \"and or\" to \"and/or\".\n\nInput\n* Next k Lines: Please change \"string\" to \"integers\". (I guess c may be an integer or a character in Part 3 only?)\n\n* The presentation works well for Part 2 because the italicised explanation immediately follows the corresponding line description, making the section easy to follow. However, in Part 1 the italicised explanation are grouped together at the end, which makes it harder to connect each explanation to the relevant input line. Please restructure the explanation so that details immediately follows the input line they refer to.\n\nExample\n* (Both Part 1 and Part 2) Please change \"color\" to \"colour\" for consistency.\n\nConstraints\n* Please add the constraints on k, x, y and c.\n\n* Please mention that all checkpoints are on empty (<const>.</const>) tiles only. (I assume they never overlap with V or H tiles?)\n\n* Am I correct in assuming that every case in this part contains at least one H, V or X (otherwise, the simplest cases in Part 2 should be moved to Part 1)? If so, please add that as a constraint.\n\nThanks.",

When I found a solution then I try to add all the 'unused' positions to an existing path and when I can't do it (I have an odd amount of position left for example) I just try with the next solution that connects all the colors. That way nothing takes more than 5ms.\n\nFor part 1 I think that a 'brute force' approach would work, you generate all the possible paths for all the colors (even on the large maps it doesn't look like it would go crazy), you place all the ones with only one possibility and then use backtracking for the rest. That would fit in the medium category.",

On closer inspection, I realised the bottom middle two tiles were blockers. The blockers (currently black) don't stand out enough against the dark blue usable tiles. Could the colours be adjusted, or blockers made more visually distinct in some way?\n\n* Similar visibility issues occur with the black circles and the black directional tiles; they're also difficult to see.\n\n* Are you planning to adjust the appearance of checkpoint tiles?\n\nThanks.",

For example, I added the following lines of code (executed one per run) after the input-reading section for the \"Medium 2\" (test) case:\n\nprint(\"1 0 2 1 e\")\nprint(\"1 0 3 2 e\")\nprint(\"1 0 2 2 e\")\nprint(\"1 0 2 8 e\")\n\nHighlighting works correctly for the first three lines, but for the last line, only one tile is highlighted in red.\n\n* I haven't tested if the same bug affects Part 2.\n\n* The red-cross blockers look clear on small grids, but harder to see on larger grids. Similarly, the directional tiles and the flagpoles of the checkpoint flags are difficult to distinguish. All black elements should be recoloured as light grey, as you suggested, to improve contrast against the dark blue background.\n\n* I completely agree with your plan to make the checkpoint flags larger.\n\nThanks.",
