Liked the square grid and decipher using characters for appropriate rows and columns.\n\nI am just daunted about seeing it later in reverse mode, maybe harder to keep a count of 26x26 grid and understanding the use of the text after it, that too in mixed cases. Should actual numbers there paired or separated by numbers instead help it become decipherable without such a clear goal statement?\n\nAlso, why are all grids sparse? I wonder is it missing a few testcases where the grid is mostly to completely filled, without much '.' voids?\n\nRest looks well to me.",

    "content": "Hey -- Thanks and thanks for the feedback.  \n\nThese aren't bad suggestions at all, but I hesitate to put too much into a Clash.  Therefore I had to \"make decisions\" about what this specific Clash is.\n\nThe joy of this to me is that letters show the coordinates of letters!!  That to me twisted my brain in a good way.  (Another clash, might use numbers for the coordinates, and that would be fine too.)\n\nI am keeping the grid size consistent throughout (always 26 x 26) to make that a \"non-issue\" (to keep the Clash simple), but it does give that sparseness.  Again, your suggestion is not bad, just not for this particular Clash.\n\nI agree that it is challenging in Reverse.  Based on your feedback, I have just now changed Test 1 so that \"T\" and \"e\" and \"s\" are all very close to top left, and \"t\" is close to the bottom right corner, so hopefully that will help.  Test 6 (with just one letter) should also help in Reverse.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Good to see that test 1 updated for reverse mode 😃",

Double-check please. And explain more what you mean by \"Your row seems to increment horizontally\". How?  Where?\n\nMy bad, I missed on that line stating that the first one is column and second one is row before the para having your example showing \"AaCdZy\" translating to (0,0), (2,3), (25,24). By the way, if you know that the first character is column and second one is row, shouldn't the convention be (0,0), (3,2) and (24,25) instead for this example (for (row, column) convention)?\n\nDouble-checking made me realize it is correct as it is not row which is incrementing horizontally, except the order of coordinate decoding example of a secretCode in the goal statement.",
