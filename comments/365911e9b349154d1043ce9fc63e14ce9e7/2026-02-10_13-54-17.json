    "content": "⚠️ Modified the contribution:\nComment:\nAll test cases had the important 1-index bit as a 1. Only the 500 question marks and 499 spaces validators had the 1-index bit as a 0.\n\nThis means that in-clash, a user can convince themselves that to deal with \"1\" appearing twice in the Fibonacci sequence they can just subtract 1 from their answer. Then get 100% on tests. But only 66% on validators.\n\nI've replaced the first \"~\" in \"High density bits\" with a \"?\" to include this edge case there, and done the same with \"Low density bits\", swapping the first \"@\" and \" \" around so the \" \" is first.",

It still doesn't quite get across that you're expected to \"concatenate\" the chars, such that \"Hello\" = 0x48656c6c6f, or \"0100100001100101011011000110110001101111\", and that you're supposed to index from the right (smallest) to the left (largest) most bit. I just kind of assumed the last part was like that since it seemed intuitive to me.\n\nAlso, it looks like you got your Fibonacci sequence wrong, which will mislead people doing the challenge.

I guess that you use sum char at index 1 only one time, otherwise your solution would have yielded 8 for the first test. The author certainly uses Fib(1, 2) to skip the 2 ones too.\nFinally on the concatenation part, you should use binary numbers - as it is written - not hexadecimal numbers.\n\nIf you have suggestions to improve this description, I will be glad to hear them as I struggle a bit to explain clearly the author's intent too.\n\n(PS: I also add few new words about concatenation, sounds better?)",

How about... \n\n\"Given a string of length N, convert each character in the string to its binary representation, until you end up with a binary representation of the original string (for example: \"abc\" -> 011000010110001001100011). Using this binary representation, and the Fibonacci sequence (0,1), select every bit whose index (keeping in mind that index 0 = the rightmost bit) is also a Fibonacci number, add their values together, and output the sum.\"\n\nIt is descriptive enough to get the intent across without giving away too much information.",
