The wording is directly taken from there, be it for the target \"Write a program that blah\" or the name of the Strength property.\nSo I respectfully suggest you take your complaints about wording there.\n\nNow about your complaint of unclearness, it looks like you're conflating speed and strength. (Correct me if I'm wrong?)\n\nI agree it's unfortunate they share a starting letter, but it's hard to think of another pair of properties that remains meaningful in the context of a horse race. Would replacing \"Speed\" with \"Velocity\" help?\n\nFeel free to constructively suggest actual sentences you'd consider more clear. \"Fix it\" category of injunctions are of no help at all, please keep those to yourself, thank you.",
