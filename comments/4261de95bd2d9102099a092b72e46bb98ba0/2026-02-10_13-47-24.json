    "content": "One concern I have here is that, with that kind of puzzle, the produced code should at least be able to solve any humanly-solvable grid. Considering the size of the grids here https://www.puzzle-shikaku.com/ (25x25 for the hard ones and much more for \"specials\"), I would recommend to add harder inputs. However your solution does not seem to be able to handle them.\n\nConsider for instance the following (not-so-hard I think) grid:\n15 15\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 15 0 2\n0 48 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 12 0 4 24 0 0 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 0\n0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 16 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 8\n5 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 12 4 0 4 0\n0 4 0 6 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0\nOn my computer, it takes almost 8min to your C++ code compiled with -O3 to find the 6 solutions (in comparison my Python3 solver takes 30ms).\n\nIf it helps you experiment, here is the testcase generator I wrote: https://tech.io/snippet/5Js9bwp",

I know it might be boring but I don't think it's too much to ask for a proper solution code. All the more so as the testcases are automatically tested against the solution code, hence if somebody wants to edit/add testcases in the future (for some reason), he would have to either replace your code or carefully pick some grids that do not make it loop for minutes.",
