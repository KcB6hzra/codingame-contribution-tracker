The monospace format makes these arrows too small to see, though; better not to format if you include the Unicode characters.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(symbol)#Unicode\n\n* Suggest to change the paragraph \"The following example shows (etc)\" to:\nDuring the 64 steps of the algorithm, the bit pairs are processed byte-wise, from left to right and least significant bits first.\n\nExample: The fingerprint {{FC:94}} means the following steps:\n\n* Suggest to add a blank line before \"At the end of the 64 steps\".\n\n* Suggest to change \"(Over index 14 restart from index 0).\" to:\nWe apply the wrap-around logic if the number of times visited is greater than 14, e.g. we use {{o}} if a position is visited for 17 times.\n\n* Please change \"respecting\" to \"respective\".\n\n* Please change \"top and bottom\" to \"top and bottom edges\".\n\n* Please change \"| for edges\" to \"| for left and right edges\".\n\n* Please change \"top frame\" to \"top edge\".\n\nInput section\n* An example is not needed here, as one example is shown below the Constraints section.\n\nOutput section\n* Please add <<11 lines:>> to the front.\n\nConstraints section\n* Suggest to mention that there are always exactly 64 steps that can be produced by the input string.\n\n* Is it possible that the bishop ends up at a corner and cannot slide at all? For example, what if the bishop is at the upper right corner and the next move is 01? If this is not tested/not possible, please mention it in this section.\n\nThanks.",
