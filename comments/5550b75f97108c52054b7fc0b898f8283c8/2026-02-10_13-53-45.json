I really think there should be an \"expert\" mode of CoC with puzzles like this, and maybe this was the case with \"Coffee break\" clashes but they're no longer there, probably because of low popularity.",

It took me some times to understand the whole thing, may be the hangover is not helping my process of though :p. Yet amazing work and this one should really deserve it place in the arena : D. Still amaze me what simple instructions can accomplish :).",

In the beginning I wanted to add even more instructions, but even with only those four time might get scarce. Anyway, I'm glad that you liked it and even if it doesn't make it, I might rework and extend it to a community puzzle. :)",

Do you think that it is more confusing than helping?",

    "content": "Yeah, I found that confusing.\nIn a real microprocessor manual, the bitwidth is a property of the register, and signedness a property of the operations (though it usually only really makes sense for multiplication and division, which aren't present here).\nAnd then it matters for reading the initial abcd values and printing them back in the end.\n\nIf I understood the spirit right, in your case I'd suggest:\n- Statement section\n  * a, b, c, d: integer registers\n- Constraints section:\n  * -2^15 <= a,b,c,d < 2^15\n  * Overflow and underflow behavior is unspecified (and untested).\n\nAnd, arguably more importantly, have negative values in the example.",

I tried to keep it simple and understandable for people who don't know much about processors or assembly in general, but your suggestions make it clearer and better.",
