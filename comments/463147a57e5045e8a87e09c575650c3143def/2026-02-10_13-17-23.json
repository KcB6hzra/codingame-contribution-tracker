Perhaps a message warning the user to take note of that would be an improvement or is it just me?",

I got it in just under 5 minutes, but that was without the stress of being in an actual challenge.\n\nPro: I like the complexity, the different solutions needed for the different parts. Also, with the examples in the goal section it is clear that all situations can occur, so the complexity does not arrive as a surprise.\nCon: the complexity might be just too much for a clash for some (I, for one, would stress out doing this one 'Fastest'. 'Shortest' on the other hand would be very interesting, because it needs multiple steps and therefore multiple aspects to making it short).\n\nNonetheless, approved, because I liked it and it is doable.",

    "content": "I very much like this puzzle but it may take too long with the ? occurring in any of the three parts of the string.  Each case must be handled differently.  Additionally, because you only provide a single example with the ? in the alphanumeric character section, it may be a surprise that the ? can occur in the place of the demarcator (the \"_\") or the parity value portion.  The strong assumption is that the ? occurs in the first part.  This makes sense as the presumption is that we must derive the whole passphrase (alphanumeric, demarcator and parity value)  by using the parity value to calculate the missing character in the alphanumeric portion.  \n\nI suggest either limiting the missing character to the alphanumeric portion or providing more examples so that the solver doesn't have the wrong impression going into the problem and thereby lose a lot of time.",
