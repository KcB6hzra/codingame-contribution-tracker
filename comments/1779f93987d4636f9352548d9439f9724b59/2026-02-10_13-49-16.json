    "content": "The 0.000 validator is quite unfair because there's no test cases like it.\nIf you want to test 0, it's better to just write \"0\" as the input. If you want to force people to check for this edge case, then you should have at least one similar test case e.g. \"9.000\".\n\nI just got 75% in a Shortest mode clash after getting 100% on test cases whereby I used a trick of evaluating the input as an expression, so that if it was an integer or float, my code could take it as it appears, but this \"0.000\" validator messed with my approach and cost me the clash.\nEspecially for shortest mode, it's important to not hide edge cases in the validators.",

    "content": "The term you are looking for is reduced fraction:\nhttp://mathworld.wolfram.com/ReducedFraction.html\n\nAlthough it is very intuitive for me, as in my native language, we use a similar word, but it should be mathematically correct.\n\nOn the other hand, I have two big problems for this. First of all, every rational number has infinitely many fraction forms, so this makes absolutely no sense at all:\n\"If there is no fraction for D\"\nWhat you want to say is that if D is integer then output A.\n\nAnd an even bigger problem is with the hint. If D = 0.5 you expect the answer to be 1/2, but there are smaller integers that satisfy your hint, like -1/-2=-2/-4=...=-A/(-2A) for ANY positive integer A. So by your hint, there is no solution at all.\n\nI know no one cares about this, and it will be accepted within no time, but this would make a great clash with the correct statement.",

To be honest, we use a word very similar to \"simplest form of the fraction\" in Hungarian, so I automatically assigned them, but I suppose most people don't speak Hungarian. :D\n\n@Qualia: I only refused it, in hopes others will notice what I wrote and the author has chance to think about my post.
