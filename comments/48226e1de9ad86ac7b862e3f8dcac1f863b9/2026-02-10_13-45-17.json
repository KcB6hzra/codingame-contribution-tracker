    "content": "It seems like test 3 should really be ccx rather than cc. The pattern is that the characters in the output string correspond to the nth Fibonacci number index of the input string, starting at 1. \"cx\" is the only test case where the length of the string happens to be a Fibonacci number. going along with the 1, 1, 2 start of the sequence, that would make it \"c, c, x\". your solution only shortens it to \"cc\" because on line 27 it ignores the last character of the input.",
