    "content": "This is a pretty hard clash, but what made it hardest (just got this in fastest mode) was the statement.\n\nIt wasn't clear to me that the 'n lines' of keys separated by spaces were the keys in each room from 0 to n - 1.\n\nI'd suggest changing\n<<The next n lines>>: The set of [[m]] keys in a room separated by spaces.\n\nto \n<<The next n lines>>: The set of m keys in each room separated by spaces. Starting from room 0 to room [[n]] - 1.\n\nI'd also change the constraints from having '[[m]]' to just 'm', since 'm' isn't actually a variable here, it's just the number of keys in each line. But that's a minor change.",
