If so, you may consider mentioning that too within statement or constraints.\n\nAlso, around Input and Output, \nrather than showing Output Line 1 formatted for A and B vector as \"AB(xb-xa,yb-xa,zb-za)\", a generalised one shall fit in better such as \"AB(b1-a1, b2-a2, ..., bn-an)\" which matches as it is mentioned in goal statement too.\nSimilarly for 'N next lines' part of the Input section, \"A(0, 1, 2)\" can be replaced with \"A(1, 2, ..., D)\" which shows that the vector will have points as per a given dimension as 'D'\n\nSeems like a fun puzzle overall",
