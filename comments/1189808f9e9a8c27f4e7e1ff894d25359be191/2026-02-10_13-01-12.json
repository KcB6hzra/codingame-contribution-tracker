    "content": "It took me looking through multiple validation examples to understand the problem and how I was expected to solve it. I think it confused me that the statement says: \"and needs you to define the number of rooms that he can have.\"  It is explained on the section describing the Output, but it gives two conflicting goals and I initially overlooked the Output description.\n\nAnother possible problem is that for the input 117, a valid Output given the constraints would be 9 and 6, and it would not be categorically wrong by the way you defined the problem. However, you'd need a different approach to get to this answer. It may even be a better answer if you consider the goal as having the fewest rooms or greater average room size instead of the largest room possible each time you use the remaining surface to make a new room.",

Given the final sum, you now need to find the roots used to reach the final sum.\nI think the new statement makes it for a better clash of code with enough data to make people think a little more, while still keeping it simple enough for blind and fast modes.\n\nI also fixed my stub generator and all the validators to fit the rules.\nThanks for your feedback",

For the example 117, there is only one solution that fulfills this request : the biggest room is 100sqm (10x10). Then you still have 17sqm that can be split into 16sqm (4x4) and 1sqm (1x1). The only possible answer is indeed 10,4,1",
