    "content": "Thanks your feedback. \nIt is a property of the tree that a relatively short path sometimes can produce a very complicated fraction. So causes some \"imbalance\" feeling in the constraints.\n\nThe constraints are selected to ensure\n1. the input path will be translated into two integers within constraint (can be handled by long int or double).\n2. the input fraction will be translated in a path not longer than the specified string length\n\nI prevent using big integers for p and q as input because it will produce a string much longer than the constraint.\n\nUnder this setting, coders should be able to translate the input into an output, and then reuse the output to translate back into the original input.\n\nWhether the code can handle very big p and q as input is not tested in the puzzle. I think it is optional for coders to implement this part.\n\nI agree my solution might fail under big p and q input. A simple solution is to us BIG INT to calculate the multiplication and compare. It will be slower than it is but will still fast enough to pass all tests.",
