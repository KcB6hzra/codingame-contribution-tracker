Kind of someone that only remembers the very last word that was said to him.\n- And n=float for only remembering part of words :-) (no, don't do that please)\n\nAnyway in its current state it is a nice clash - and possibly with one or two short [[theOriginalPhrase]] cases added it might serve as a very interesting reverse as well.",
