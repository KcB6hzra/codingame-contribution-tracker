    "content": "Goal section\n* Please change \"least loudest\" to \"least loud\". (\"loudest\" = \"most loud\", so \"least loudest\" = \"least most loud\" and doesn't make any sense.)\n\n* Please explain how houses are labelled. Are they 0-indexed or 1-indexed? (That means, are the house counted starting from 0 or 1? Are they counted in the same order as inputs?)\n\nInput section\n* You have to include line numbers and variable types here. Also, you have not fully described the input format. Suggest to rewrite like this:\n\n<<Line 1:>> An integer [[h]] for the number of houses.\n<<Next [[h]] lines:>> 4 space-separated integers [[l1]], [[n1]], [[l2]] and [[n2]].\n[[l1]] and [[n1]] refer to the first neighbour.\n[[l2]] and [[n2]] refer to the second neighbour.\n[[l1]] and [[l2]] indicate how loud the neighbour is.\n[[n1]] and [[n2]] indicate how nice the neighbour is.\n\nOutput section\n* Please move your explanation of the example to Goal section. Output section is for describing what to output, not giving an example.\n\nPlease write this section in the format like I did above for input line 1.\n\nConstraints section\n* Do you mean [[h]] instead of [[n]] for the first constraint?\n\nCases\n* Each of the last three pairs of tests and validators are the same. Please revise them so that each pair is similar but different.\n\nStub generator\n* Please change the second line to provide 4 integers instead of 1 single string. Normally this should be parsed for the player unless we expect parsing to be part of the focus of the clash.\n\n* Please add a write statement (e.g. \"write answer\" or \"write house number\").\n\nThanks.",
