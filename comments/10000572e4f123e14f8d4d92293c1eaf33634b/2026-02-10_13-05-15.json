    "content": "Nice clash, I thought the description was a bit long, but it isn't too hard to read it all, and then most of it is the detailed explanation which is helpful.\n\nThe only problem I've found is that I tested the tests/validators and found an issue where if a clasher was not careful with taking the absolute value of the differences between consecutive stations then your choices of tests/validators can lead to a problem. The specific problem case is if the clasher remembers to take the absolute value of the x distance, but takes the raw value of the y distance. Then they will pass 100% of your current test cases, but fail 80% of your current validators!\n\nIt would be good to swap at least a couple of these pairs around to remove this possibility and allow such an error to be debugged in-clash. Example Ruby code below.",

    "content": "Thank you for this contribution. I think it is going to be quite a challenge for the 15 minutes of clash of code and also a good test for the more advanced coders.\n\nOne of the criteria for acceptance is that it needs to be solvable within 5 minutes for the clash of code. It could help to make this solvable more quickly to clarify the line \"Diagonal distance between two diagonally aligned points is the difference between the 2 x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).\".\n\nMy proposal :\n - Diagonal distance between two diagonally aligned points is the _minimum_ difference between the 2 x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).\n- Straight distance is the maximum distance between the 2 x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) less any diagonal distance.",
