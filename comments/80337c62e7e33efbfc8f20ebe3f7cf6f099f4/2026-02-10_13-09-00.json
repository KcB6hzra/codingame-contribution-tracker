It's easy enough to realise this is implied though, and the statement is already long enough to not warrant a clarification, but I thought I'd comment it here for completeness. :)",

Something along the lines of \"You are given a list of N amounts of water. Determine whether or not it's possible to measure exactly X ml using these beakers, for each target X.\", maybe?",
