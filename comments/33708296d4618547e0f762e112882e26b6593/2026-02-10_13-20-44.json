Considering the input comes in no particular order, maintaining the order in the input does not make sense. The only other thing I can think of is to sort alphabetically OR numerically based on the number in the username since you state that the username has a number... Please resolve this and reply so I can approve the puzzle.\n\nGreat work!",

Each comment can have only 1 priority...?\n\n* I don't understand this sentence:\n\"And the same goes for replies, if a reply is moved, the reply appears above all the other replies that are below it in the same comment.\"\n1. As you have written in the previous sentence, once the order of the parent comments have been determined, the related replies will be moved together.\n2. As one of the constraints states that there are not nested replies, my understanding is that the next step would be to sort the related replies based on priority/likes/date.\n3. If the above is true, there won't be a case where replies have to be moved based on other replies, and there isn't such a thing as \"reply above other replies\", as they are just sorted based on the criteria?\n4. If I have missed what you mean, would you please explain and show me an example (e.g. which test/validator is the explanation applicable to)?\n\nThanks.",
