    "content": "Nice clash. I always find these number spiral clashes hard, but your solution is really intuitive and quite simple. I had previously thought that you needed to do a recursive solution to be able to solve these quickly (and I struggle with coding recursive solutions under time pressure).\n\nThe only issue I have is that it's enabled for Reverse, but there's only 4 test cases. I think it's always better to have more test cases for Reverse mode, so that clashers can really understand what to expect in the validators. Here the important thing is that [[n]] is always odd, but with only 4 test cases it might not be clear that that is true and a clasher might waste time trying to figure out what their code should do for even [[n]].",
