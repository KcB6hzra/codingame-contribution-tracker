When a contribution already exists and I am editing it, a bad connection results in an error message (something like 'you are not in the latest version of this contribution'). However, when the contribution does not yet exist (uploading for the first time), a bad connection can simply result in multiple new contributions.",

So many times that I always wonder why and how it can be fixed. So, thank you for your input and I'll try to follow it up if I can. :)",
