    "content": "This clash is written in a way that makes it seem extremely complicated and confusing when it's actually very simple.\n\nSuggestions to make it a lot easier to understand:\n\n\"You must apply the same rearrangement algorithm to each section separately.\" =>\n\"You must order each section separately\"\n\n\"[...] in ascending order with the fewest possible swaps.\" =>\n\"[...] in ascending order.\"\n(the number of swaps is irrelevant, this is very misleading)\n\n\"For each section, the cars in ascending order based on the number of passengers after the necessary swaps, separated by a hyphen \"-\".\" =>\n\"For each section, the cars in ascending order, separated by a hyphen \"-\".\"\n\nI just got this in a clash, and basically had to ignore the description and just assume the logic based on the first test case in order to solve it quickly. The only other human in my clash wasn't able to solve it, while one bot solution took over 6 minutes, and the other took 14m48s.\n\nI think clearing up the description will make this much easier for people to understand and solve.",
