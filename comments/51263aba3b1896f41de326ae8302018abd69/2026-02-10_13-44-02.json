    "content": "There are many different ways to find the solution here, I'll explain some.\n\n1) If you know a bit of group theory, distinct colorings problems can all be done with Burnside's Formula. This one is no exception.\nHere the rotation group is the dihedral group D6.\nIts elements are :\nid : (1)(2)(3) -> 3 orbits\n3 symmetries : (1)(2 3), (2)(1 3) and (3)(1 2) -> 2 orbits each\n2 planar rotations : (1 2 3) and (1 3 2) -> 1 orbit each\nSo the number of colorings is :\n1/6  (n^3 + 3 n^2 + 2 n).\nWith this approach you can solve the general problem for a M Pearl Necklace.\n\n2) Here it's a particular case where D2n is Sn (the group of permutations) - usually D2n is only included in Sn.\nSo if you know advanced combinatorics, you'll recognize a combination with replacement.\nThe general formula is : C(n + k - 1, k),\nso here it's C(n + 2, 3) = (n + 2)(n + 1)n / 6.\n\n2 bis) Without knowing the previous formula, you could use a combinatorics module, for example in Python the following script is a valid solution :\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement\nn =int(input())\nprint(len(list(combinations_with_replacement(range(n), 3))))\n\n3) Even if you have only basic notions of combinatorics, you can see that there are 3 types of necklaces :\nthose with 1 color : C(n, 1) possibilities\nthose with 2 colors : C(n, 2) possibilities x 2 (choice of the dominant color)\nthose with 3 colors : C(n, 3) possibilities\nHence the solution :\nC(n, 1) + 2 C(n, 2) + C(n, 3) = n + n(n - 1) + n(n - 1)(n - 2) / 6.\n\n4) You can use 3 nested loops and count the number of necklaces. You make sure that they're sorted to avoid dupes.\nFor example the following Python script is a valid solution :\nn =int(input())\ns = 0\nfor i in range(n) :\n    for j in range(i, n) :\n        for k in range(j, n) :\n            s += 1\nprint(s)",

For example, pair A and B will give following sequences: \nAAB - BAA - ABA\nBBA - ABB - BAB\nHence, there should be an additional multiplier.\nFinal solution is\nn + n * (n - 1) + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6",
