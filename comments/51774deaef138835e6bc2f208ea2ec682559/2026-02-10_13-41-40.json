(adding a beginning symbol to prevent false positives) \nfinally i take a function (with an internal loop) and check if the current prefix at it's current expansion, is in the rest of the words. Probably horrible for optimization, so that would be neat to have a true long test. Like others have said.\n\nWhat could really break this is if each word has a similar word 200 words down.\nMeaning like \"find\" is the first word, and word 200 is \"fine\"\nthen \"mild\" is the second word and \"mildew\" is the 201st word etc... because this forces my loops to not break for a long time.",

One way is to migrate one puzzle from the perl weekly challenge into the codingame training challenge. first, i called for advices from different people in the perl community and from codingame as well to know if this approach was correct and accepted. then, i hope that, like perl folks know well the perl weekly challenge, they will be curious to see how a known puzzle can be handled in the codingame platform. finally, like they will know more about codingame, i would believe that they will participate to the fall challenge 2020 coming soon (I already made a call there: https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/i4ybpj/game_code_challenge).",

But the fact that 3 people approved it and none of them noticed that (at the time) half of the constraints were not satisfied in one test/validator pair is horrific. I can clearly see that you responded to all comments and made a lot of changes.\n\nUnfortunately the added statement is also not satisfied by the last test/validator pair:\n\"If a word shares all its prefixes with the other different words, then, to avoid starvation, its prefix will be itself, and all its prefixes cannot be used by other words.\"\nExample: \"verbose\" shares all it's prefixes with the other occurances of the same word and therefor by this note it's prefix should be \"verbose\".\n\nUnfortunately I don't speak Perl, so I cannot tell you where the problem is in your solution regarding this test case but based on what I think you do this:\n1. sort the list of words (completely agree)\n2. for each of the words that are not the last one.\n  a) compare each prefix of the word with the next in list until it matches\n  b) store said prefic + 1 char in an array\n3. look up prefixes for the original order of words\nBut yet again, this is purely speculation.\n\nEither way for Test 5 you have multiple occurances of \"verb\" and \"verbose\" so any consistent prefix searching should return either \"v/verbo\" (minimal match) or \"verb/verbose\" (maximal match),\n\nIf I'm right what you are missing is that you have to compare for not just the next word's prefixes but for the previous word's prefixes as well.\n\nFor all it's worth I think you should just delete the last test-validator pair as it adds only to the confusion. You can also clean up the complications regarding this case from the notes and make it a nice easy puzzle.",

    "content": "After some time thinking about this, i would imagine a good stress test would be VERY long fake words, with 100's of similar beginning characters. It required this code in order to time out\n\nfor i in range(2701,2900): words.append(\"a\"*i)\n\nusing that word list (200 words with 2800 characters average) i don't wish that on you to put in it, and i'm not sure i could optimize it much more personally. Some one else maybe could, but having that as the options for testing optimization seems overkill.",

    "content": "your code is fine. abit  longer than suggested soltuin, but each of your lines is way lighter, and many people prefer simple statements.\n\nin many trainings, you will face the same pattern when reading input. you can make it one liner, something like:\n`words = [ input() for _ in range(int(input())) ]`\n\nthe suggested code has also 3 loops, execpt that the 3rd one is not nested in the 2d one which does all its job first.",
