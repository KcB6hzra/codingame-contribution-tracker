    "content": "Nice clash, but there's a couple of issues I noticed.\n\n1. You never explicitly state what kind of rounding to do, just saying \"output the distance that zeno travelled after s steps rounded\". You should say \"rounding up to the nearest integer\".\n2. You ask the clasher to \"output the distance that zeno travelled after s steps rounded\", but what you really output in your code and tests is not the \"distance [...] travelled\" but rather the final position of Zeno. If it were about the distance travelled then you wouldn't need to add it to \"start\" at the end.\n\nHopefully you're still active and able to make these edits soon.",

A new mechanic is for example having the ability each step from choosing to add a value v[i] to your distance so far and you can't choose to boost yourself 3 times in a row. This is one mechanic for example which is solvable using dynamic programming and isn't just a basic problem \"code the statement\".",
