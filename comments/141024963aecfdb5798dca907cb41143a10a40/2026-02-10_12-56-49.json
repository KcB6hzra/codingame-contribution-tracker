    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: Fun and fast. As a guitarist, I had to try it. :)\n\nJust a quick note about what you call the “first string”:\nIn music, the first string is the thinnest (high E) and the sixth string is the thickest (low E).\nTo avoid any confusion among musicians, I would explicitly state in the objective: “The strings are numbered from 1 to 6 in the order in which they appear in the input” (or something equivalent). \n\nGood work!",

    "content": "Hello! That's a really nice idea you got there, a fun math problem wearing a cool guitar costume.\nI think that the example is very helpful, but it carries a lot of the explanation, and the overall text is a bit long compared to the amount of rules that need to be understood (could also be a strenght considering it makes the problem really easy to understand).\nI also noticed that some of the informations are only suggested by the example (the order of the strings particularly).\nAlso, maybe you wanted people to find it by themselves (in that case it is totally fine), but the numbering rule could be expressed in a more compact way like with a formula.\nThanks!",

    "content": "General\n* The concept is straightforward, though the explanation can become a bit lengthy. The suggestions below largely follow what you've written. You may want to omit or simplify some of the points so that the statement can be shorter.\n\nGoal\n* The statement relies too much on the example to convey the rules, instead of defining the rules explicitly first and then illustrating them with an example. Please consider replacing the second paragraph with the following text:\n\nOn a standard guitar, there are 6 strings, floating over a fretboard of 21 frets. Each string can be played either open (no finger) or with a finger placed on a fret. Each such position corresponds to a unique number.\n\nThe numbering of the fretboard is defined as follows:\n- The open string of the 1st string is numbered {{1}}.\n- Each fret increases the number by {{1}}.\n- Each string has {{21}} possible notes (open string + 20 frets).\n- Numbering continues string by string.\n- The 21st fret of the 6th string is numbered {{132}}.\n\nSeveral notes played together make a chord.\n\nA chord is written as 6 values separated by hyphens, one per string:\n- A number between {{1}} and {{20}} means the string is played on that fret.\n- {{0}} means the string is played open.\n- {{X}} means the string is not played and should be ignored.\n\n* After the above change, modify the example accordingly:\n\n  • Change \"An X means the note is not played\" to \"indicated by the {{X}}\".\n\n  • Delete \"called\".\n\n  • Show the number for each string, and the answer to the example.\n\n* Replace the final paragraph with:\n\nYour task is to translate the played notes of the given chords and output the sum.\n\n* Players might get confused by the different numbering conventions (for example, the open string is represented by 0 in the input but treated as note number 1 when calculating the output). You might want to add a short tip at the end to alert them.\n\nInput\n* Consider deleting \"Any number means the note is played. Any X represents strings that are not played, thus should be ignored.\" for simplification.\n\nOutput\n* Please add \"played\" before \"note\".\n\nConstraints\n* Please delete the second constraint.\n\n* Please add the following:\n\nEach [[chord]] contains exactly 6 notes.\n\nFret values are between {{0}} and {{20}}.\n\nCases\n* Please add one or more cases to include fret values not yet covered in the existing cases.\n\nThanks.",
