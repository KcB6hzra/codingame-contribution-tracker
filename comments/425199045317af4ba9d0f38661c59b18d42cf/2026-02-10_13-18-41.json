    "content": "Nice clash, but the tests and validators don't actually test all of the statement.\n\nYou specify \"Output must be alphabetical\", implying that the output should be ordered from \"a-z\", but then all of your inputs are already ordered in such a way that if clashers simply print the letters in the order that they are found in the string, then they will be sorted already.\n\nThis is tricky in Shortest mode, because clashers will not be sure whether they can trust that the validators will also be like that, so they have to choose whether to spend extra characters sorting the output or take the risk and submit code without sorting that scores 100% on tests, but might fail validators.\n\nI'd suggest either simplifying the challenge to say that the letters are printed in the order they were found, or adding a test/validator pair that is out of order to test for this. :)",

    "content": "General\n* The current output format highly favours Python, because a dictionary can be directly printed without modification. Hence,\n• I highly suggest to change the format to a more general one (e.g. output each pair of key and frequency every line, with a space betweeen key and frequency).\n• Also specify the format properly in Goal section.\n\n* The characters in the input strings are always in alphabetical order, and again, because of how dictionaries are treated in Python, you don't have to even think about how the keys should be ordered in the output. But obviously,\n• You HAVE to specify what order the keys should appear in the output, and\n• Unsorted strings should be tested. (by unsorted I mean the first occurrence of the letters)\n\n* Just a reminder: the contribution guidelines state:\n\"language-specific outputs should be avoided in CoC.\"\n\nhttps://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/contribution-guidelines\n\nConstraints section\n* This section is for the limits you impose on inputs (and occasionally outputs). Please remove the examples.\n\n* The number of characters can go to this section, e.g.\n1 ≤ length of [[s]] ≤ 100\n\nInput section\n* Please follow the example in the contribution guidelines for the presentation. Suggest to change to:\n<<Line 1:>> A string [[s]]\n\nOutput section\n* Please remove the example.\n\nGuidelines on writing statements for your reference:\nhttps://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/statement#guidelines\n\nThanks.",
