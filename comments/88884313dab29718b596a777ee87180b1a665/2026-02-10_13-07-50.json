    "content": "The phrase \"Your friend uses dating apps and is sick of having to go through multiple group photos to figure out which person holds the account\" could be clearer. A more precise phrasing might be \"to identify the account owner in group photos,\" as the word \"holds\" does not read well in this context.\n\nThe phrase \"figure out the person who is in all of the photos and output their description\" is somewhat awkwardly phrased. A simpler alternative is: \"Identify the person who appears in all photos and output their description.\"\n\nThe phrase \"If there are multiple people who appear in all photos or there is no-one who appears in all photos then print Catfish Alert!\" could be interpreted in several ways.\n\nSuggested revision: \"Output the description of the person who appears in all photos. If no single unique person appears in every photo, print 'Catfish Alert!'\"",

Also, I have disabled Reverse as I don't think it's nice to reverse engineer a clash with such hard-to-read inputs, but happy to hear counter-arguments.\n\nHere's some code I wrote to generate the test cases, in case anyone is interested:\nhttps://ato.pxeger.com/run?1=dVLLbtswEAR65FdMZBSQHEuwempaKEXR3ttDb6oQ0BJlEqYolY8IgaMv6SWH5qf6NV1FduBLL-Q-ZofD3f39x4bdw9PTc_Bt-v7vG2WKG9agQJxnWZZvE2CF6xxtb-GlQN1bK2oPbtworINqEVAUyBlddLri7Vh-51rgBzdGNPim1b1I3UG9eF-5PZydiskZ7GRvPTrRqNClUqi99PBc64qNc9pLZaAFN6iDvX-oWD1Hd7YfDXa6N42AJeKd5vUB_wvrIDAoc8DeCmEwBDtoUbGWJKe3OJYuc7yj0Aby1RpfrWhUXmJ1rE-RCZIrG1XriHIT2BC8g2Gc2NqyYqobyAq4xRafEIc0TzKvOuGyjg_HGYIJH0DXCoTtnRc2dglznsrMBbTJfH_Hz48yN3fY-cyFjlF_5hnFLqzfXbIT-ZQFo36lJa-ScruBCxXr7X4pnSGP6hHc2kUijYw0ElvmpGp9rBJco1yTrA14RSovUwxzIbmhbWnA0_JxIn_hvcvX0cfoFIx-GmrOshnzA8QUfeG-VU7isxbWX0XLxp0W77yA_wA",
