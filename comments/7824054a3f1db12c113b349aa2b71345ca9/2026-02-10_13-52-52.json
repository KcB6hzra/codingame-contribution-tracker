    "content": "Hello JBM,\n\nThanks for your feedback !\n\nI don't know if there is a limit in Codingame input length (and where to find it). \nI can generate a longer input but from what I've read, the naive algorithm has a  complexity of O(n²). The manacher's algorithm is the only one running in O(n).\nI timed the last tests and I need around 250 ms to solve it. With a algorithm in O(n²), it won't be possible to do it in less than a second.\n\nMoreover, I solved it in Python3. If I increase the sequence, maybe some languages won't be fast enougth to solve it (for example VBA or javascript)\n\nI'll maybe add a final test with a input which is a full palindrom of 5000 chars.",
