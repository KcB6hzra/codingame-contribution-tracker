    "content": "How does this got approved? There is literally nothing in the goal or description mentioning overnight travel and how to solve it. To make matters worse Test/Validator 4 checks the late version of night travel which will succeed even if you don't consider this as an option. It literally means that 40% of the test cases has not been covered by the description or just systematically doesn't matter.\n\nIt's not the test cases that have names so at least the players would have a little help regarding that. This problem needed a lot of work before it should have gotten approved.",
