    "content": "I had this as reverse.\nI saw it was something to do with radices, but in 15 minutes I didn't figure anything out. I didn't type a single keystroke.\n5 tests is not enough for something like this. The first two examples are completely different from the others.\nI also submitted a reverse clash using radices, with modulo, easier to spot than this, and with far more tests, and got a slew of downvotes.\nI would have enjoyed the challenge in fastest mode.\nIn reverse, I have to admit that I lost interest the second I saw the capital letters.",
