I could be mistaken though.",

You're not mistaken at all! The issue is so common on CG that I hesitate to bring it up at all…\n\nAdditional comments from me:\n\nInput\n* Please remove the note and revise the description according to @User123's suggestion in point 1.\n\nOutput\n* Please state \"separated by a space\".\n\nConstraints\n* Please delete the final constraint (\"Both strings… included\") and rewrite it following @User123's suggestion in point 3.\n\nCases\n* \"Call a Bondulance\" (Test 4): Please delete the third input line.\n\nThanks.",

Also, digits are always standalone words in the third pair of cases.\n\n  Would you please create a new pair of cases in which:\n\n  • words_A > words_B, and\n  • digits form part of a word?\n\n  There are several ways in which digits may form part of a word, involving different combinations of letters, digits, and punctuation. For example:\n  • 24/7\n  • $731k\n  • v2.0\n  • Y2K\n  • win32\n  • A4\n  • H2O\n  • 1984\n  • 3D printer\n  • the above examples or similar combinations + punctuation\n\n  Please construct new cases using patterns such as these.\n\nThanks.",
