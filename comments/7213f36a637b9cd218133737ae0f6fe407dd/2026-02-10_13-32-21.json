Not only because it could be too challenging under time pressure, but also because of the real-world relevance. As a puzzle, it would be available for everyone to visit and revisit. I know I would! :)",

You can pass all other test cases and validators just by sorting on their index. I recommend also having a test case which checks that, as it is very easy to forget to sort, especially if you are able to pass all test cases without it.\nAlso, is there any particular reason to favor a 1-based index?",
