    "content": "Funny how the statement mentions no less than *three* times that the Collatz conjecture is only applicable to \"positive integers\" and yet, out of the blue, we get test cases with negative numbers.\nIt is, in my opinion, unreasonable, especially in fastest, to expect anyone to notice the little footprint in the output section about negative numbers, especially when statement says, multiple times, \"Given a *positive* integer\".\nI can already tell many people will be very annoyed at this especially when you consider that the Collatz conjecture is a very well know problem (which by the way we already have on CoC). Nobody who knows anything about the Collatz conjecture will expect to be given non positive integers, let alone output  \"1\" in such a case.",

    "content": "I am sorry but that is simply not true.\nYour statement ends exactly as follows:\n\"Given a ***positive*** integer, output the number of numbers in the sequence starting with the number before it reaches 1, starting the loop.\".\nNow, I am certainly not a native speaker but I fail to see how one can reasonably expect to be given a negative number after reading that. The addendum \"If the number is negative or 0, just output 1.\" is therefore unexpected since the first statement supposedly guarantees that you are given a positive integer in the first place. The \"Statement\" section clearly contains all the information to solve the problem as it describes both the input and the expected output. I do not think the \"Output\" section should be used to introduce new rules that go against everything that has been said before. And, speaking of which, it seems very weird to me to ask to output \"1\" in cases where there is absolutely no way to solve the problem as described. Such cases should have an output which reflects the fact that they do not have a valid answer, such as \"Impossible\" or maybe -1 if you want to keep it short. Asking the player to output what could pass as a valid answer when there is none is not an established CoC practice.\nNow it is not my intention to start a flame war but please understand that there are clashers who like to have clear, unambiguous statements. The top of the CoC leaderboard is an incredibly competitive place. It is simply impossible to win if you take the time to read the entire statement or run all the test cases. One can only blame himself if the error comes from an incomplete reading of the statement but, in this particular case, the statement is unfortunately misleading. As I've said before the Collatz conjecture is a very well-defined problem. One who knows it should not need to read the entire statement to complete the clash. Consequently, if you are to add unconventional inputs, it is preferable to mention it very clearly, and most of all early, in the statement.",
