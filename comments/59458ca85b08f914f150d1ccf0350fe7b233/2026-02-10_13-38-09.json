However, if you go to next turn really quickly (by pressing on the next frame in the viewer), the animation stops halfway. Not sure how the SDK does these things, but it might be easy to fix. In any case it is not really important. I just thought you might like to know it does this.\n\n2) In the description of steal, you speak of player1 and player0, this is a bit confusing. Maybe say \"first player\" and \"second player\". Or maybe someone has a better idea how to describe it.  I understood it perfectly, but that's because I already know what it does. \n\nYou can check here how it is explained in yavalath: https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/yavalath",

    "content": "For now I am going to recommend adding pie rule/swap/steal to this game. Player one seems to have a major advantage when playing most starting moves, except the corner move. These are the results of my meta mcts so far. Corner move being m:0\n\nNodes created: 647068\nm:0 visits:129414 win:46,4% status:2\nm:1 visits:129414 win:58,3% status:2\nm:2 visits:129413 win:60,1% status:2\nm:3 visits:129413 win:70% status:2\nm:4 visits:129413 win:61,2% status:2\n\n(I'll keep the result updated)\n\nSteal/swap works as follows: On the first turn player 1 makes a move. player 2 then decides to take over that move or continue playing. When he steals the move, Player 2 gets player 1's color and  let's player 1 move again. That way, the player first to move, has to play a balanced start. It has been implemented here: \n\nhttps://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/yavalath\n\nBecause of the steal, yavalath is balanced. If it did not have steal, player 1 would always win when playing center (this move is solved). This rule can never hurt a game, aside from the small inconvenience of coding it. Games can only become more balanced with it, not less.\n\nTo read more about steal, go here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_rule",

If you add the steal option, then player 1 will simply never play move 3, because otherwise, player 2 will steal it.\n\nInstead player 1 will play a worse move, like move 0. Then if player 2 steals it, the game is still balanced.\n\nSteal wil always help balance, because player 1 is forced to start with the most balanced move. It's very much possible that this move is solved as a draw.\n\nAlso, lack of balance is a huge problem. You're right that CG submits from both sides, but what will happen is that with a sufficiently unbalanced game, the top bots will simply always win as player 1. Then it doesnt really matter anymore which bot is the strongest. Your bot could be stronger than mine, but i would still always beat you as p1.",

Then you dont need to bother with the turnindex (after a win check of course!)",
