    "content": "If full unicode was possible in a clash, I'd have liked to have done a real IPA conversion, but since we have to stick to ASCII I decided to make this one. It's sort of a step toward IPA transcription, but still using English letters and a colon for long vowels. (Also a \"yu:\" instead of \"ju:\" because English speakers would find that confusing.)\n\nI think it shouldn't be too hard, and I'm even tempted to allow Reverse mode, since the test cases show the transformation rules and the test case names explain when to apply them... but for Shortest and Fastest I think it should definitely be solvable either way. Hope you enjoy!",

    "content": "Thanks. I'm glad you like it. :)\n\nThat's a good point about Reverse, it's always best to have enough samples to be sure of the rules. But 10 test cases is a lot, I often get annoyed in Fastest or Reverse mode when there are so many tests because it takes time to check them all and if you submit before they all finish you sometimes pay the price! :P\n\nI might just stick to Fastest and Shortest for now at least.",
