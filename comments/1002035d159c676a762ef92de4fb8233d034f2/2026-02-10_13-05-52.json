I think it might be good to have a small testcase that can show the difference between queue and stack.",

The iteration system coupled with the triangular mechanics make for a clash that's complex enough to be entertaining without being too complex or too heavy to read or done. And I have to admit that I really enjoyed the pokemon version of the \"scissors leaf stone\". The description was very clear and well structured so that it was easy to understand and read at a glance: handy for the chosen speed mode. It would have been interesting to put it in codegolf but personally I'm bored of codegolf clashes with some \"identities\" in. The test suite isn't detailed enough to allow a reverse but it's more than enough to cover all the problem cases. So I think it's a \"Good one\".",
