    "content": "This is a great simulation logic, but currently, I am wondering if this is really suitable for CoC ? the story is cute, but pretty long and the strict equality checks on floats is a real trap due to precision errors. It looks more like a classic puzzle to me, as it stands now. For a CoC, maybe you can switch everything to INT (just a suggestion) ?",

    "content": "Some things are less than intuitive to me.\n1. The additional CPU-instruction is a nice gotcha but does not add anything.\n2. The halt instruction is a bit ambiguous. I would expect it to mean halt - full stop - print the output and exit. Halting 4 times seems redundant. \n\nAlternatively 'H' could mean 'hold', and continue adjusting if another shift occurs. This would be reactive, and thus swap the timing between instruction and shift. As a bonus, this would solve point 1.\n\nIt might be too long reverse mode, but I would like to see what percentage of players can do it in under 15 minutes :)\n\nOther than that; good concept, clear statement, fun puzzle!",

I included the additional CPU instruction so that the halt instruction becomes intuitive - once the CPU outputs the halt instruction, all movement should cease. I will consider changing the halt instruction to a hold instruction instead and/or only requiring one 'H' instruction if it makes more sense!",
