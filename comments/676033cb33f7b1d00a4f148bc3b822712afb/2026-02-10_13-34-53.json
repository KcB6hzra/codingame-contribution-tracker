    "content": "There are quite a few improvements that need to be made before I would approve this, but the idea is good. Here are my suggestions:\n\n» Statement: The letters of the alphabet occupy positions A=1, B=2, C=3... when listed in alphabetical order. Compute the sum of the alphabetical positions of the letters in the given sentence. The positions are case-insensitive, and non-letters are ignored.\n\n» Input: A sentence\n\n» Output: An integer representing the sum of the alphabetical positions of the letters in the sentence\n\n» Constraints:\n1 ≤ len(sentence) ≤ 256\nCharacters are either uppercase or lowercase letters, spaces, or {{! @}}\n\nNote that your current solution only excludes ASCII characters below 64, which means that characters like { or ^ would not be handled correctly. You need to address this explicitly in your statement and constraints (I took a guess and assumed that only !, @, and spaces were your intention).",
