The stretch of road under construction is referred to as a construction zone or a construction site.  Since you use the term \"construction site\" several time, I'd like to see the variable names changed to \"siteQuantity\", \"siteKm\" and \"siteSpeed\" or \"zoneQuantity\", \"zoneKm\" and \"zoneSpeed\".  (By the way...I did confirm this with my Civil Engineer long-time construction buddy.)\n\nI think this puzzle is easy enough to be a Clash of Code.  However, I also believe the possible solutions will provide a wonderful comparison of straightforward approaches vs. modern \"Pythonic\" approaches and seeing these style differences is one of the things I find most powerful about easy puzzles.\n\nOther than my hang-up on the variable names, I am ready to approve.",
