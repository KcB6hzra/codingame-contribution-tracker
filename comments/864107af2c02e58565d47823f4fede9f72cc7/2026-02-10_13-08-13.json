Everything is clearly presented with a well-crafted introduction to the challenge. The tests are thorough and accurate. Overall, it's a solid and enjoyable challenge. It might be a little tricky to be an easy challenge (in Java, it's always a mess to manipulate characters), but it's acceptable.",

    "content": "Nice job! Do you want to try to use the words ciphertext and plaintext here as you have done in later puzzles?\n\nTest Case Design: I found a couple validators to be quite a bit harder than the corresponding test case.\n\nTest Case 1 - no wrapping in the encoding of the word\nValidator 1 - 100% wrapping in the encoding of the word\n\nI suggest adding a test case and validator (or even two TC/Val combos) between TC/Val 1 and TC/Val 2. By doing that you can have no wrapping in TC 1 and Val 1 and then you can have wrapping in TC 2/Val 2. You might even consider adding another test case where the encoding the word involves both wrapping and not wrapping.\n\nTest Case 2 / Validator 2 - I found the validator to be harder than the test case. The test case is about as easy as you can make it with the word matching the first letter of the message and using a space as the separator. In the validator, we have to check both sides of the word and we have to make sure to check all separators. I would like to see more test cases/validators that test all the following:\n\n1) word matches very beginning of message\n2) word is found in the middle of the message\n3) word matches the very end of the message\n\nI don't think you need to say anything about this in your Goal, but I think it's important to test that the solutions properly consider the beginning and the end of the message as implied word separators.\n\nOverall, I really like your idea and I especially like your multi-puzzle idea exploring other techniques using the same structure. I personally like when an author uses a significant number of test cases to try to cover all edge cases.\n\nBy the way, I watched \"The Imitation Game\" last night.",

[[key]] is non-negative in this puzzle.\n\nFor example, with a [[key]] of {{3}}:\n- {{a}} becomes {{d}}\n- {{w}} becomes {{z}}\n- {{x}} becomes {{a}}\n\nThe encrypted message contains both lowercase and uppercase letters, and the original case should be kept in the decrypted message.\n\nNon-letter characters should be kept unchanged.\n\nOutput\n* Please change \"The decode message\" to \"The decrypted message\" (the same term you used in Input section).\n\nConstraints\n* Please change \"Len\" to \"Length\".\n\n* Please delete the first constraint.\n\nStub generator\n* Please add a write statement, e.g. \"write key and decoded message\".\n\nCover picture\n* Suggest to upload a cover picture for the puzzle.\n\nTitle\n* It's a bit weird to have \"Episode 1\" at the beginning of the title. Maybe add a series title before \"Episode 1\" (though the part after \"Episode 1\" may have to be shortened)?\n\nFor your reference, I've searched the existing multi-part puzzles and found the following:\n• Binary neural network - Part 1\n• Binary neural network - Part 2\n• Derivative time !!! - part1\n• Derivative time !!! - part2\n• Is the King In Check? (Part 1)\n• Is the King In Check? (Part 2)\n• The hungry duck - part 1\n• The hungry duck - part 2\n\nThanks.",

For example, if the guaranteed word is \"chief\", and one of the words in the decoded message is \"handkerchief\", they'll still match.\n\nSo, even if after further thought you don't want to make the puzzle harder, you still have to fix this issue and add more cases to cover such a scenario.\n\nHope this helps!",
