    "content": "In the hope it encourages someone to try to create a puzzle also, there is the little story behind this puzzle😅\n\nI wanted to create my first contribution on Codingame and having played many COC involving collatz conjecture, i knew that conjectures can be a good area to start as some are very simple to understand, code and verify. \n\nSo i went online looking for one like that and after few hours of reading about conjectures i found this one. Then i decided to code and test it by myself. i wrote a pretty simple code. Then i decided to use it to make a puzzle. \n\nI ended up creating 2 puzzles in the same topic, one COC and this classic puzzle. The COC didn't even used a sieve. (i didn't know about the sieve of sudaram (and all the others, excepted Eratosthenes because of school) before starting to work on this puzzle. )\n\nBut for the classic puzzle i decided to make it more challeging to pretend to medium, so i searched for a faster way to do find primes numbers up to n than just checking each number up to sqrt(n) and i found the sieve of sudaram than i used here, but the code i found on geekforgeeks was slow in lookups so i improved it a little bit and here we are. \n\nSo if you're thinking of creating a puzzle and you're a little bit afraid, just start and know that the community is here to help you.",

It was quite frustrating because I optimized my solution with memoization and a quite optimized prime computation (less than 30% numbers are tested).\n\nReading your solution: \n- the sieve sundaram algo is interesting. I didn't know about it. Your explanation should definitly talk about it as I really feel like it is not possible to solve the puzzle without it (at least with m up to 1000000)\n- the OOS in your solution is a good idea but again, your explanation should talk about expected output in case of unexpected input",

    "content": "Hi C6PO. Thanks for your feedback.\n- in fact they are many sieves that can work here (Sundaram, Eratosthenes, Atkin...) as long as the time complexity is better than N^2. So even for those seed we must look for an optimized version of them. By exemple the code for the sieve of sudaram i'm using in my solution comes from the website geekforgeeks, but i have to optimize it a little bit by changing the dprimes dictionnary to improve the lookup time for it to work...\n- I've decided to remove the OOS aspect from the puzzle completly following the suggestions of other community members, i've just omited to remove it from my solution as it still works , and the solution is not meant to be seing buy players... But yeah, i'll probably do that too\n\nPs: i didn't know about the sieve of sudaram (and all the others, excepted Eratosthenes because of school) before starting to work on this puzzle.  I wanted to create my first contribution on Codingame and having played many COC involving collatz conjecture, i knew that conjectures can be a good area to start as some are very simple to understand, code and verify. So i went online looking for one like that and after few hours of reading about conjectures i found this one. Then i decided to code and test it by myself. i wrote a pretty simple code. Then i decided to use it to make a puzzle. I ended up creating 2 puzzles in the same topic, one COC and this classic puzzle. The COC didn't even used a sieve. But for the classic puzzle i decided to make it more challeging to pretend to medium, so i searched for a faster way to do find primes numbers up to n than just checking each number up to sqrt(n) and i found the sieve of sudaram than i used here, but the code i found on geekforgeeks was slow in lookups so i improved it a little bit and here we are.",

But i don't mind changing it if it make the puzzle more understandable... Should i ?\n\nIdk, maybe someone with editing rights allready fixed it, but i don't see the extra \"the\" you're talking about. The sentence is the exact one you are suggesting.",

Technically though, a factor is a number that divides another number, leaving no remainder.  This puzzle does not have any division or multiplication in it, so factors do not come into play.  Prime Factor Decomposition would indeed involve multiplication and division so the use of the word factors works there.  You can leave it as is or change it to be technically correct. This puzzle will be successful either way.",
