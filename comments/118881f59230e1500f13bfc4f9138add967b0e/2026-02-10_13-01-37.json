A couple of things to tidy up:\n\n1) I think you can completely get rid of the ASCII representation section now, right?\n\n2) In two different places, you used 'x' and 'y'. I believe those should both be 'r' and 'c'. The x data definitely corresponds to rows and the y data to columns.\n\n3) Thank you for the link my tutorial! Please remove the hyphen between \"Algorithm\" and \"X\". The URL does have a hyphen, but that is just because Tech.io replaces all spaces with hyphens when it generates URLs. I am already working on pages for your two puzzles, so maybe can you eventually put the link right to the Tetrasticks page.\n\n{{Memory lapse deleted.}}",

Could you have test cases that are different shapes and sizes? I am going to blame this monster idea on you. It was your idea to create the solo player game which has the cool graphics and now I crave MORE test cases. I expect my code will solve any new test case, so I think I'm just craving more visual stimulation! (There are some really cool shapes made out of Tetrasticks on the Internet.",

Please forgive me if some of the comments below are too early at the moment 🙇🏻\n\nRules\n* Please change \"a board description, that have\" to \"the description of a board, that has\".\n\n* Please change \"4 line segment\" to \"4 line segments\".\n\n* Please add \"the\" before \"same intersection\".\n\n* Please break the overview into two rows (similar to what you had before) for clarity.\n\n* Please show how each tetrastick is represented in actual input (similar to what you had before), because such information is vital for parsing.\n\n* Not sure whether it's CG's cache issue? The old image showing no crosses is still shown instead of the new image, even when I check the website on another browser 🤔 Hopefully the issue will resolve itself later…?\n\n* Suggest to change \"grid of squares\" to \"board of squares\".\n\n* Suggest to change \"even better\" to \"more precisely\".\n\n* Please explain which point or edge of a tetrastick we are talking about when we say we want to place it on (row, column). (Say, use an unflipped, unrotated J-shaped tetrastick as an example.)\n\nExample\n* It's better to show the F/R example with the full F/R pieces for easier understanding.\n\n* Please add \"the\" before \"J-shaped\", \"board\" and \"example\".\n\n* Please change \"therefor\" to \"therefore\" (\"therefor\" is an old word), and add a comma before the word.\n\n* Please change \"Z shaped\" to \"the Z-shaped\" (with a hyphen).\n\n* Please add \"a\" before \"horizontal flip\".\n\nGame input\n* Please mention that game board consists of either <const>.</const> for an unoccupied space or a tetrastick ID for an occupied space.\n\nOutput\n* Please delete \"before placing on board\" because it seems to imply that flipping is performed after rotations.\n\n* Please add a comma before \"0 otherwise\".\n\n* Please change \"h - shaped\" to \"h-shaped\".\n\n* Please change \"placed to\" to \"placed on\".\n\nStub\n* Please change \"read remaining:string(17)\" to \"loopline n remaining:word(1)\".\n\nThanks.",

Instead, just show the same tetrasticks as the ones shown in the viewer, so that the segments of each tetrastick and the part of the grid which acts as the bounding box (mentioned in the later part of the statement) are clearly shown, something like this (for all 16 tetrasticks):\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/JG3ZZFW\n\nI think it's much more relevant that way.",

Let's take an unflipped, unrotated J-shaped tetrastick as an example. What should be the output for this if I want to put it on the top-left corner of the board?\n  |\n|_|\n\nASCII representation\n* I'm sorry but it's still too long to show, even if I expand the window to full width of my screen: https://imgur.com/a/elqDFGo . I think breaking the rows into 6, 5, 5 (instead of the current 9, 7) should do the trick.\n\n* Only the F, H and O pieces are represented using those respective characters, while all the other pieces are represented using the character O only.\n\nStub\n* Please change \"read remaining:string(17)\" to \"loopline n remaining:word(1)\".\n\nThanks.",
