I'd like to suggest that the default response be hard coded to the solution of the first test case, so when testing all the languages a nice \"pass\" is shown.  Great challenge.  It took me about 20 to 30 minutes, was brute force with no optimization required, so around the \"Easy\" range seems inline with the difficulty of other 'easy / medium' challenges.  I like it, so I am Accepting this contribution.  Thanks!",

    "content": "I gave this a shot for half an hour, but ultimately I have no idea what this puzzle is asking me to do. Find the volume based on the heights of the bottom of the pool I assume? I can see in the solution the water level is somehow dependent on the cells around it, but I don't get how that's in the description. \n\nI'm assuming you want to know how much water is in each zone of a pool if it is allowed to drain and there is water left in the pool afterwards. \n\nBased on the puzzle statement alone I would rate this as a hard puzzle as the puzzle description is the bottleneck. But ultimately I would abandon all hope of solving this based on not knowing what it's asking. \n\nMaybe some ascii art would help the idea. Here's a helpful diagram idea. \n\nhttp://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8c1a9997-0da6-4975-920d-482f5f55e535",
