The extra complexity is not too much I feel.\n\nAlso, could we not add a positive look-ahead for repeats if we know the word has repeated letters, instead of ignoring if we see gray and other colored positions, say if s has at least 2 occurrences:\n(?=.*s.*s)\n3 occurrences: (?=.*s.*s.*s)\nthese would be used if not all green positions for the letter have been found.\n\nThat aside, medium difficulty is quite fitting.",

Being able to see them after solving is fine, and I think having them simply numbered is useful to differentiate them from tests, personally. Most important thing is that they won't be visible for anyone while solving, and only ever seen by the minority of people who choose to look into the details afterwards.",
