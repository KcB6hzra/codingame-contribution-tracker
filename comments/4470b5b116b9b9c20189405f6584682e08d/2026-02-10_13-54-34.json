    "content": "My forecast is that it's going to be *very* dependent on who reads it. Some are going to panic at the very sight of \"Rubik\", others are going to recognize it for the trivial problem it is.\n\nThe more general point is: it's the easiest in the series, but it has its place. It's doable in clash (hence my submitting it there), but it could actually make sense to duplicate it to community puzzles once the others \"can it be solved this way\" are approved, to enable a more gradual difficulty slope.\n\nMy proposed sample solution is 78 characters (though I'll admit I didn't spend as much on it as I would have on a clash). How long is yours? :D",
