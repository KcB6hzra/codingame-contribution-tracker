    "content": "Big fan of what you did here!  While I agree with the other comments regarding the initial \"OMG\" reaction to the wall-of-text explanation, I don't think it's a problem nor something that needs changing.\n\n99.9% of everyone who will attempt this puzzle will be completely familiar with the concept of toppling dominoes (probably with first-hand experience, too).  The rules for how the dominoes interact are incredibly intuitive, as is the ASCII representation of their angle. \n Very early into reading the explanation I realized where this challenge was heading, and sped-read the remaining 4/5ths just nodding and thinking \"yep.  yep. \n sounds right.  makes sense.\"  I'm sure most everyone else will have the same experience.\n\nIt's a programming challenge you can quickly understand, offers plenty of creative freedom in how you choose to solve it, and has that nice balance of \"complex-but-not-confusing\".\n9 outta 10.  Love it.  Gets my approval & upvote!\n\n\nP.S.:  Lot's of potential for variations/\"sequels\" with this puzzle.  e.g.: display the map after x dominoes have fallen, determine the minimum number of dominoes to rotate in order to leave zero standing, add a ball ('o')  which \"rolls\" in the direction it was hit until it hits something, etc.",
