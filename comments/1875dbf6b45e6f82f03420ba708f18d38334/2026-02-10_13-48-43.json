Can't we just say \"thickness of T\" instead of \"T m\"? I'm open to discussion on this one, as it became a standard in many puzzles\n\nAlso, sentences related to goal are scattered everywhere. You almost created a new paragraph for every single sentence. Group your sentences to small amount of paragraphs and group those paragraphs with the logic they relate to. For instance: Start with a paragraph that tells about the rules. Then create a new paragraph about the goal. Man, I've lost at least 1-2 mins while solving the puzzle because of how disorganized the statement was\n\nI've upvoted it because I like the theme but can't approve it at this state of the statement",

Not too simple, not to hard, just fine.\nI just see the following problems :\n  - \"Basically, by folding a piece of paper in half, we make it higher.\" -> The information that the height is doubled with each fold is not clear enough (even if logical)\n  - In the statement, the expectations are not clear enough. A final sentence to describe what is expected will not be too much (ex: \"The goal here is to compute the number of folds required, and the required width of the unfolded piece of paper\")\n  - The text in the 'output' category is not formated as usual. A nominal and short sentence per variable help for the readibility.\nIf this get fix, I'll probably approve this CoC. :)",
