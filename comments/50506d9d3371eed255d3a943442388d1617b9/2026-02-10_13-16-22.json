    "content": "Thanks for thinking along! I was a bit lazy with writing the solution and eval/exec was the first thing coming to my mind, but I like the fact that multiple approaches are possible.\n\nThe sequence of operations I find difficult to implement, because there might be multiple solutions (for example 24 6 6 0, for which +--, -+- and some others are possible). So, then I should either include 'there is always only one solution' and pay attention to the cases (which I don't like), or I should include some rules as to ordering the output of multiple solutions (which I also do not like because I prefer to keep the number of rules low). Also, it then should be additionally stated that the order of the four numbers should remain the same.\n\nInstead, I've now chosen to keep it very similar to the original intent (either it is possible or not possible), but I have split the possible situations in two: with only addition, or with some combination of addition and/or subtraction.\n\nWhile answering you, I realized there is the option of only subtraction (e.g. 27, 1, 1, 1), and I realized that my previous code assumed the numbers to be always in the same order (1,27,1,1 in my previous code came out as not possible). So, I've added a case in which order matters (1,27,1,1 should be reordered to 27-1-1-1 to make it work) - or, you can of course just include a fourth operator at the front (-1+27-1-1 also works). And I have the feeling there might be other solutions altogether, one of which you might have.",

As for implementing that in code, reshuffling the numbers is pretty much the same as including a minus sign before the first number without reshuffling (i.e.: -1+27-1-1 in code is a lazy solution for the situation in which reordering to (+)27-1-1-1 is required).",
