On a side note, I'm not sure what is the significance of \"Marco Polo\" for this puzzle.\n\nSome edits for the text:\n\nGiven two integers [[A]] and [[B]], print {{Marco}} if the sum of the products of the digits of [[A]] and of the digits of [[B]] is greater than the product of the sums of the digits of [[A]] and of the digits of [[B]]. Otherwise, print {{Polo}}.\n\nIf [[A]] or [[B]] is negative, then all the digits for that number should be considered negative.\n\n<<Example:>>\nGiven [[A]] = 12 and [[B]] = 34, the sum of products is (1*2) + (3*4) = 14, and the product of sums is (1+2)*(3+4) = 21. Therefore, the output is {{Polo}}.",
