The solution which was wrong was posted AND FIXED 15 minutes after I posted this puzzle. The reason it was wrong was because I originally had a different statement and I wrote a solution for that, since the statement changed I also changed the solution.\n\nI used the solution to make test cases. random.org for numbers and then my solution for the results. It couldn't have been wrong..\n\nUPDATE: I was just suggested by a fellow CGer that I might have updated the solution but  forgot to save it. It's possible that this had happened, therefore the solution from the first statement was still there.",

Take any real life situation, you don't always know how many things you need to do, but you know when you need to stop\n\nIt obviously got validated because not everyone wants all the puzzles to be the same.

And I'm pretty sure the reason we do this with most puzzle is that there are language that don't support the \"while(STDIN-is-not-empty)\" thing.\nI'll look into this and if it is indeed the case, I will have to edit it. The question is fine as is, I personally don't mind doing extra work parsing inputs, but it still feels odd that the default stub doesn't give all inputs. I would rather have it give nothing and say \"parse inputs by yourself\", than just give one line",
