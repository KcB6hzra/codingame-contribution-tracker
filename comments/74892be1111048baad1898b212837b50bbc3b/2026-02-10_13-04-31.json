Some accompanying notes:\n- Rummikub 1 is an approved medium puzzle - but for me it started with this contribution, and I only split it up in two parts because there is a case limit of 25 cases.\n- In my humble opinion, Rummikub 1 and 2 combined is much nicer than only Rummikub 1. The Joker is a nice additional logical challenge, and there are several ways in which code can be optimized versus what is sufficient for Rummikub 1.\n- Most of all, I look forward to seeing others solve this one and put my code length and run time to shame. I suspect that I am unaware of certain optimization possibilities, and that I approached this problem way too complex - with way too long solution code.",

The easier cases are moved to Rummikub 1. To make a relevant split, Rummikub 2 has the following differences:\n- Rummikub 2 includes the Joker tile;\n- Rummikub 2 has cases with more rows and more required steps. Where in Rummikub 1 you can solve the cases by simply trying all possible actions, that approach will time out in many of Rummikub 2's cases.\nI hope the CG community agrees this is a Hard-level puzzle, and a valid separate contribution from the Medium-level Rummikub 1 contribution.\n\nI keep this (and Rummikub 1) in WIP at the moment, because with this split into two contributions I can suddenly look for extra cases to include again :-).

There are two tiles of each number-color combination.

    "content": "Thanks a lot for taking your time (again) for my contribution :-). As for your COMBINE to TAKE case, that's right - though it is partly covered in COMBINE to insert (case/val 9; there you must combine to do something in the middle of the middle row, which would be the same as when you would have to take that middle of the middle row).\nAnd, I surely would like to include this one, BUT: I discovered yesterday there is a case limit of 25, which I have currently reached :-(. Based on that I would like to ask your thoughts on the following, if I may:\n\nPotentially, I could turn this into two contributions:\n- a Rummikub 1 contribution without J. Kind of the current cases 1-15 that you solved, but then with some extra edge cases, maybe also duplicate rows in there and/or that a step can be done equally from two distinct rows together with also a rule to select lowest rowid if you have multiple options, and a couple of longer cases). \n- a Rummikub 2 contribution (with higher difficulty level) that is all about J and optimization aspects (at least the optimization aspects that I have been able to tackle) - varieties of J use, and longer cases.\nIf I would split it in two, it means that with solving the difficult one, you also have the solution code for the easier one - and I don't like it when there are two contributions on Codingame that could use identical solution code. I prefer to have one complete contribution. However, with this one I got the feeling that due to the case limit I am not able to make it as complete as it possibly could be.\n\nSo, given that you started coding, some questions for you:\n- If I would make two contributions as described above, what should the difficulty level of Rummikub 1 be (how 'hard' did it feel for you so far)?\n- Do you have any opinion on one versus two contributions in this case?",

And I am glad that Rummikub 1 came through - hopefully Rummikub 2 now will also gain interest, but at least with Rummikub 1 we see some outcome of our hard work :-).",

I thought 'no problem, lets force an extra action before that in one of the cases', but somehow I do not manage to manipulate the current cases in that way. I just looked at Rummikub 1: also there COMBINE is simply the first action. I think that in many cases, there is only a need to COMBINE if you can do it right away. If you force the COMBINE one step away, it makes the COMBINE redundant (for the cases that I have tried).\nFor example, \n1 1G 2G 3G\n2 4G 5G 6G\nand you would want to COMBINE in order to take the 1G.\nI can manipulate this to make the COMBINE initially impossible by:\n1 1G 2G 3G\n2 5G 6G 7G\n3 4B 4G 4R 4Y\n(Before the COMBINE you now must take the 4G) --> but then the COMBINE is redundant because the 4G itself helps already to make the 1G free.\n\nI need to think a bit about it more; let me see whether I can find a case that needs COMBINE where it can not be the first step, and if I find it, let me see whether I can squeeze it into an existing case or whether it warrants an additional case.\n\nNicely found by the way :-).",

Yours however is wisely guided along a path, so you have to somehow implement that generic order into the wisdom (or solve it with an ugly hack).",

The issue with a Rummikub 2 I could see would be about the amount of changes that are needed to properly handle the Joker when you have solved Rummikub 1 (is it enough to justify a separate hard puzzle).\nI'm currently at the point where I've solved Rummikub 1, I'm now going to make the changes in order to handle the Joker and I will give you my final thought on Rummikub 2 when I can pass all the current tests.",

If you find out that adding it is not too much work, I should make the split between version 1 and 2 somewhere else (maybe on only small cases where simple brute force can be applied versus bigger cases that require smarter path/row/tile selection), or not at all.\n\nNB I'm glad that also without J you classify it as Hard. For two weeks I tried and miserably failed to build a full Rummikub algorithm. Defeated, I settled for rules like one TAKE one PUT. The fact that with those rules someone still classifies it as Hard, makes the defeat by the full Rummikub feel less bad :-).",

I'll try to cover that better in the rules, I agree that the current statement is ambiguous on this point (something like 'a split only happens when an identical tile is placed', and I meant it also somewhat with 'value of J is never fixed').\n\nEDIT: I did not add it to the split rules, because the Joker is not yet explained there. Instead, I rephrased under the Joker paragraph: \"The actual value of {{J}} is never fixed (while displayed as {{3R 4R J}}, it is not fixed whether {{J}} is {{2R}} or {{5R}} in this run; also, adding {{5R}} to the run {{3R 4R J 6R 7R}} does not split the run, since {{J}} is not fixed as {{5R}}).\"",

It will be explicitly a stepping stone to the second (Hard level) contribution, which will include all aspects of the current contribution.

For my own idea, I have cleaned away all Joker steps and many optimization steps from my code for Rummikub 1 - it easily solves all cases there while it quickly times out in Rummikub 2.\n\nApart from that, I am playing with the idea to include in Rummikub 2 a rule on how to deal with multiple rows that can be used for the same technique, and to include row combinations like\n4Y 5Y 6Y 7Y\n4B 4G 4R 4Y\nand the need to take 4Y (with the rule that you have to take from the lowest rowid when there are multiple options). I am not yet sure whether I like that dynamic, though - it has nothing to do with the real Rummikub (in the real Rummikub it simply does not matter from which row you would take; only for our coding environment we need to be consistent).",

I have implemented everything, except for the suggested changes on cases - for that I will take a bit more time.\n\nSome specific remarks:\n* Stones versus tiles: ah, my first language is Dutch, in which we use *steen* - literal translation *stone*, but of course it must be tile. For the starting tile I have shifted to the name [[goalTile]].\n* Input Line 1 mentioning the Joker: that is because there I explain how a tile is displayed. I do not find the case 'J' as goalTile interesting. However, I do think that at that line it is the most logical place to introduce how tiles are displayed - and it feels incomplete not to mention the 'J' there. Any suggestion on changing the location of this? Personally, I do not think it is too big a problem if I suggest 'J' can be input, but in fact it never is.\n* Optimization test: with {{PUT J 16}}, row 16 becomes {{5Y 6Y 7Y 8Y J}} (J can be 4Y or 9Y here, but is according to the rules displayed to the right). Then later on, {{PUT 6Y 16}} results in a split, with two runs {{5Y 6Y J}} (row 16) and {{6Y 7Y 8Y}} (row 21). Another way of seeing this is that we have {{J 5Y 6Y 7Y 8Y}}, with which a split by {{PUT}} with the middle stone is possible. This we do ({{PUT 6Y 16}}, resulting in {{J 5Y 6Y}} and {{6Y 7Y 8Y}}. In displaying these runs, however, J is always shown at the right side. In other words: J is always displayed to the right, but that does not mean that J equals that value (it can just as must be the left value - depending on the need).",

    "content": "...and one remark in a separate comment, because also I exceeded the word limit. I must admit: your exceedance was because you made a lot of valid points, while mine is simply because I use a lot of words. It is what it is.\n\n* The case to have J as leftmost tile can only be created if J is the goalTile and there is only one run with space left ending at 13 (eg. 11Y 12Y 13Y). As earlier said, I do not find the case with 'J' as goalTile interesting (it would only be this single case with one row, and it requires a solution that is not necessary in any of the other cases). If another stone than 'J' is the goalTile, there is only a reason to put J leftmost if your goalTile is to the left of that  (eg. 11Y 12Y 13Y with goalTile 9Y would require J to be put at 10Y). However, that intermediate step of putting J leftmost will never be visible; the table is only displayed after putting goalTile. There is no other reason to put J leftmost - if your goalTile is related to another location without the need of 'J', there is never a reason to replace 'J' to some other position where it would need to be leftmost.\nAs for the set case, I decided that there 'J' is always displayed rightmost anyway (so, it would be {{3G 3R 3Y J}}). The reason for this is: it is most straightforward to always display rightmost. Only in the case of 'J' filling a place inside a run, this is not preferable (3Y 5Y J does not look good), so that it the only exception I created. In fact, I would not even care too much about {{12Y 13Y J}} -- the only rules are a maximum number of 13 tiles for a run and 4 tiles for a set. The fact that there is no 14Y, should not necessarily mean that J cannot be a 14Y. \nAnd also with a set: there is actually never a reason to add a 'J' to a set, except if it would be a goalTile. Any existing set is at least 3 tiles, and if you cannot add the goalTile to this, there is never a reason to add another tile to it. You do add a fourth tile to a set to take one of the existing ones - however you would never add a J as fourth tile to a set in order to take an existing 4Y - if you want to use 4Y and have a J, you could simply directly use the J as 4Y.\n\nOk, I can think of one case with J not as goalTile but still possible forcing a leftmost situation: goalTile 12Y, runs 1Y 2Y ... 12Y 13Y and 5B 5G 5R J. This would need to become 1Y 2Y ... 12Y and J 12Y 13Y (or, according to my bold statement above, 12Y 13Y J). I am hesitant about the added value of this case - and whether it is relevant to include in the statement that J can never by 14 or that J must be displayed leftmost if the most right stone is 13 to force a leftmost situation); what do you think?",

    "content": "Thank you for your feedback! OK, now I know the story of tiles becoming stones. 😛\n\nRegarding your question of Input:\n* I understand your reasoning. I would suggest to:\n  • Line 1: change \"tile\" to \"non-Joker tile\" (twice).\n  • Line 1: delete \"- or J, indicating a joker\".\n  • Next nrow lines: change \"tiles\" to \"tiles (a non-Joker tile or a Joker tile, indicated by {{J}})\".\n\nRegarding your comment on the Optimization test:\n* I haven't realised, until now, that a joker tile may be moved around in a run when another tile in the same run is added or removed, and yet that doesn't need any {{TAKE J}} or {{PUT J}} action. Indeed that's shown in the first Joker test case. Maybe it's a good idea to add a sentence to explain that, or maybe not… I'm not sure.\n\nRegarding your comment on J being used as the leftmost tile:\n* Your explanation is sound, except that I don't like the notion that \"The fact that there is no 14Y, should not necessarily mean that J cannot be a 14Y.\" But this is your puzzle, so you can set the rules any way you like.\n\n* However, if in the future there are cases where a joker tile must be treated as a 14, please mention that in the statement.\n\n* Also, the current description in Goal section does make a very careful observer wonder why a joker tile can only be displayed at the right or in the middle, but never at the left. I think we can leave it at that for now, and see if other moderators have any views about that treatment.\n\nRegarding your last question\n* As the CG platform forces you to pass every test and validator before your contribution can even be uploaded, there's a limitation of what cases you can include in it. In my opinion, it isn't a big issue as long as your cases have a reasonable coverage of the possible cases in general. And you do have a variety of cases.\n\n* Maybe when you can come up with an improved algorithm, you can create a Part 2 of the puzzle in the Very Hard difficulty category!\n\nComments on the revised version:\n\nGoal section\n* Actions: Please add explanation of what TAKE and PUT do.\n\n* Actions: Suggest to change \"it is not allowed\" to \"you are not allowed\".\n\nCases\n* Please let me know when you've done updating the cases, and I'll review them again (note to myself: in conjunction with my first round of comments).\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "* I will think for a bit about adding more explanation on moving around the J. The fact that you only say PUT J 16 (and not 'as which stone') in fact implies that J can either be 4Y or 9Y - only for display matters there must be a consistent rule (like 'display to the right'). And the idea that you would want a TAKE and PUT to shuffle J inside a row would imply something like TAKE J 16 -> PUT J 16, which is weird. But maybe I can add to 'display to the right' that this does not mean that J has taken that value, or that J can take any value within a row (but that is already the nature of J).\n\n* Explanation of TAKE and PUT: I did add in \"One action can be either to take a tile from a row, to put a tile in a row, or to combine two rows\", before listing the format of those actions. Maybe I am too deep into this puzzle to realize what is not yet clear: how can I explain more about what TAKE and PUT do?\n\n* Outstanding issues that I will make you aware of when solved/changed: \n- J vs leftmost / 14 value;\n- Possibly including cases that strictly test the max 4 per set / 13 per run versus J;\n- Cleaning the cases for more than two identical tiles;\n- Reorder input of some cases.",

If you consider for display purpose *always* displaying {{J}} at the right no matter what tile it stands for, that may make it more like a wildcard? In comparison, when you specify {{J}} to be displayed at a particular position, that seems to imply {{J}} stands for a particular tile.\n\nOr maybe it's a thing that I should just twist my mind and get used to 🤪\n\n* Ah, I've definitely missed that explanation of TAKE and PUT, as usually available actions are presented one by one. May I suggest to change the first sentence like this?\nOne action can be:\n• {{TAKE}} [[tile]] [[rowid]]: take a tile from a row,\n• {{PUT}} [[tile]] [[rowid]]: put a tile in a row, or\n• {{COMBINE}} [[rowid_1]] [[rowid_2]]: combine two rows.\n\n* Noted on the outstanding issues (and note to myself: first round of my comments on cases).\n\nThanks!",

I think there are already quite a lot of cases, and the interesting aspect (in my opinion) is in how to find the correct solutions. If I include cases that test the statement rules to the letter, those cases will be the less interesting ones - so for now I keep them out. I did add the following sentence to the Joker paragraph: \"The actual value of J is never fixed (while displayed as 3R 4R J, it is not fixed whether the J is a 2R or a 5R in this run).\"\n\nAlso, I added one bigger case at the end with a lot of duplicate rows. For that, I also added in the statement \"- If multiple rows can be used for the same action, use the row with the lowest rowid.\"",

    "content": "All right, sounds good to me.\n\nGoal\n* Actions: I don't suggest to separate the three possible actions (the • ones). I suggest to group them together for easier comprehension, and then add a newline before the additional specifics (the -- ones).\n\n* Joker: Please format \"J\", \"\"2R\" and \"5R\" as {{constants}}\n\nConstraints\n* I think the first constraint may be removed. For most of the CodinGame puzzles, this is implied. I think mentioning is needed only when the problem space contains cases where there are multiple solutions, but only those cases with a *unique* solution are chosen for the puzzle.\n\nI'm raising this now because the addition of the multiple row rule has made me review the constraints again. I don't think there are unique solutions for this puzzle, the multiple row rule means that we're guiding the player to choose one of the possible solutions for the final output.\n\nCases\n* Multiple row rule: Is the newly added pair the only cases where the rule is applicable? If so, I would suggest to modify one or two of the earlier pairs (e.g. pair 12) so that the rule needs to be applied there as well. Reasons: 1. Better to have rules introduced one by one earlier. 2. Don't waste the rule, heehee.\n\n* Multiple row rule: Are there cases where this rule applies even though there are not duplicate rows? For example, goalTile is 5B, and there are rows of 6B 7B 8B, 2B 3B 4B and 5G 5R 5Y. If there aren't such cases, would it be a good idea to add them?\n\n* row reordering: Would you please reorder the input rows in Validator 15 so that the output actions do not concentrate on the first half of the rows?\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "* Goal remarks: processed\n* Validator 15: rows shuffled\n* First constraint: removed\n\nAs for the multiple row rule: I started this contribution with the idea to only include cases with unique solutions. I recently added the final test/validator because it was one that I earlier failed with, but later on achieved with the (rather simple) optimization to ignore duplicate rows -> hence the need for that additional rule. I do agree with you that if I keep this last one in, I should make sure the rule is relevant in more cases - which brings me to that I need to think about whether I find this added dimension interesting enough or not. If it stays in, it is definitely also applicable to multiple distinct rows that all can accept the same tile, and frankly I am not sure whether I find that an interesting aspect.  At the moment, there are no other cases where this plays a role.\nSimply selecting lowest rowid in a small case I do not find very interesting. That aspect becomes only interesting when the choice between different rows is buried somewhere deep in all the possible steps, and for that reason the player will need to keep track of not only the path found to the solution, but also the equivalent paths along the way, in order to select the final solution path based on the given rules (COMBINE as early as possible, no J, J as early as possible, and finally lowest rowid's first).\nNB: the need to select out of several solutions is currently present in the final case: after removing identical rows there are 257 unique solutions to that one, which is mainly because of the J in row 1 that can be or not be replaced by a 12Y at any point. Interestingly, J is never technically taken there, so I will have to adjust the rules to select a solution without using J in any way (which can be to TAKE, or even to replace within a row).",
