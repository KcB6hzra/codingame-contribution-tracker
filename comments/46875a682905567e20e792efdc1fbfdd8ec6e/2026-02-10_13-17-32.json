It seemed as if I would never get my team teamings teamed up just right!\n\nI loved your puzzle. Your write-up is very well done. The test cases are clever. The material is plenty challenging, but I think it works in the \"easy\" category. I like to see the Codingamer looking for an easy puzzle still challenged with material such as this. Overall, great job!",
