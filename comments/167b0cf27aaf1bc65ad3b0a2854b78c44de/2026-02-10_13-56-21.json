(The final paragraph doesn't help at all--I'd drop it if I were you)\n\nMaybe put a bit more plain english before the math? Something like \"A number is called happy when repeatedly summing the square of its digits yields 1\"\n\nAs a side note, this ends up with code a bit more complex than I'm used to in 5-minute clashes, but that's not necessarily a problem.",

Like, say, one that ends in 1 and one that doesn't.\n\nAbout the length, I think it's feasible to do in 5, but I'm biased. A more objective observation is that it's harder than the average 5-minute problem currently in the pool. Not sure how it fares wrt the current 10-minutes problems, I haven't done any in quite some time.",
