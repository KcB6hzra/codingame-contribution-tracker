    "content": "Good! That looks ideal now. Question: Is the leading zero necessary in test case 1? See: -----\n\nIt can be misleading in reverse mode. Maybe introduce the zero by itself as a first test case.\n\nI'll also add some formatting and constraints to your statement.\n\nAlso note that 59741093046 in test case validator 3 cannot fit in an 32-bit integer.\nIt's especially vicious in that it's a validator. So all your local tests will work but you will never get 100% if, like me, you solve the puzzle by accumulating the digits into a 32-bit variable.\n\nThis issue concerns mostly lower-level languages but it is an important one. I've added a constraint to remediate it.\n\nThat said I recommend you make test case 3 a 64-bit number as well to ensure it fails if the user tries to fit it inside a 32-bit variable.",
