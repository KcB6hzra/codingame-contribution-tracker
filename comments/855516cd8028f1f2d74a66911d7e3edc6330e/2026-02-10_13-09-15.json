    "content": "This clash is good, but the statement is currently very unclear.\n\nThis bit is so important but you don't actually explain what the numbers in parentheses mean, so clashers are forced to work it out from the test cases:\n\"There are 8 ranks :\n\nF (1), E (15), D (30), C (50), B (70), A (80), S (90), National (100)\"\n\nYou need to explain that the ranks are determined by your level and that F is levels 1-14, E is levels 15-29, ... etc.\n\nI just got this in a clash and only me and the bots solved it. The other humans both got 0%.\n\nA basic change I would suggest is to change the part I mentioned to the below:\n\n\"There are 8 ranks, which correspond to levels (in brackets) as below:\n\nF (1-14), E (15-29), D (30-49), C (50-69), B (70-79), A (80-89), S (90-99), National (100-150)\"",
