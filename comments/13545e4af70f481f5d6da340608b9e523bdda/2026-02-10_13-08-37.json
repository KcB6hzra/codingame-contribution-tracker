    "content": "Nice clash, but the final validator is the only test that covers the hardest edge case of what to do when a character follows a double digit.\n\nI just got this in a clash and got 100% on tests in fastest mode, so figured that this edge case wouldn't be covered and submitted, only to get 80%.\n\nThere should always be a matching test for each validator, otherwise clashers don't get the chance to debug their code before submitting. I recommend adding a test/validator pair where the test has something like \"23d\" in it to show that this needs to become \"233ddd\".\n\nSolving with regex is a lot easier if you can assume this edge case won't occur, so it's important to include it in the test cases so that clashers know they need to spend the extra time solving for it.",

Since this is a clash of code, it may be needed to explain the behaviour for 0 explicitly in the statement to reduce the complexity. As an alternative you could  introduce some early and very simple test-cases that show the behaviour with multiple numbers very early. You could for instance use WH33L, C00L, NO3L as very simple test cases early on so the developer can get familiar with the difference in behaviour.",

    "content": "I like this puzzle but the tests/validators are incomplete and don't always match. The basic things to test are digit + letter, digit + digit + letter, digit + digit + end of string, zero + letter, zero + digit + letter, zero + zero + letter, zero + zero + end of string.\n\nTest 4 has two zeroes (00) with letters afterwards, but validator 4 doesn't have them. It is certainly interesting how 2 zeroes interact when more letters are behind, and also at the end of the string. I would make both test and validator 4  have *00* and *00\n\nThe only time we find out what happens when 2 digits other than zero are next to each other in the input is in validator 5. Test 5 also has 2 digits but they are at the end of the input so we don't know if a letter afterwards would have been repeated.\n\nIt is not obvious from the statement what happens with strings like \"23A\" or \"03A\", because \"23A\" -> \"233AAA\" is what happens when you apply the repetitions all at once (otherwise it would be an infinite loop), but when applying the same logic to the string \"03A\" you get \"AAA\" instead of the intended \"A\"",

But I might have a suggestion, after looking at the test cases/validators, and after reading some comments here. \n\nI came here to see what was wrong because everyone of the 7 players that submitted a solution all got 80%, and I suspect that the \"double 0\" from the validator 4 got us all. I would suggest to either tell a bit more about double digits in the statement, or add more test cases about them (as the only double digit currently is in Test 5, but it's at the end, so it doesn't give any more info about how to handle them).\n\nOther than that, nice clash!",

    "content": "Also, based on your description \"the first character after every digit has been multiplied by that digit\", it isn't clear why Test 4 should go from:\n\"0h_L0RD_WHY_0_IS_0THIS_00__So_C00L\"\nto:\n\"0_L0D_WHY_0IS_0HIS_0__So_C0L\"\nrather than:\n\"0_L0D_WHY_0IS_0HIS_0__So_C0\"\n\nSince the \"00L\" should lead to a \"0\" followed by 0x\"0\", but then the second zero should multiply the \"L\" by 0 also, removing it.\n\nThis would make more sense considering that's how you apply the rule for Test 5 with the \"33t\" part becoming \"3333ttt\". The 3 after the first 3 is both multiplied and also multiplies the following letter.\n\nSo you are currently treating double digits differently between these two tests...",
