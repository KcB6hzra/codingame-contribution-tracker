While the formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon is indeed (N*(N-3))/2, we also need to connect the points to each other in a manner that would be the sides of the polygon. There are N vertices and hence we must add N to the formula at the end, giving the diagonals of the circle, not the N-gon.",
