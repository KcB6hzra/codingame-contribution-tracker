    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: Insanely interesting puzzle: cracked my head trying to figure out a reasonable solution and ended up with 85 lines of convoluted Python code and a huge sigh of relief. I have a feeling that this is between the border of Medium and Hard difficulty, but that could also be my opinion because I struggled with this one a lot, so you can change it if you too feel like it.\n\nAlso, looking back from my initial struggle to understand the question language due to the phrase \"pixel grid\" being mentioned (and that being clarified afterwards), I would suggest rewriting it just a bit more into something like:\n\nGiven a shape plotted in a coordinate axis (containing H x W squares) using a set of points, determine and output the points used to draw the shape, starting from the top-leftmost vertex of the shape, towards the right in a clockwise manner. The top-leftmost vertex of the grid is (0, 0), with the X-coordinate increasing towards the right and Y-coordinate increasing downwards. A single square represented in the input is made of S units of length.\n\nThere are no hollow spaces or diagonally touching squares (forming the shape)",
