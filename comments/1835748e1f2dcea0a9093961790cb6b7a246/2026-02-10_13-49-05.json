    "content": "Good problem. A couple of lingering thoughts:\n\n- This has been said, but the stub generator should automatically split the lines into integers for the player.\n- Your constraints indicate that the values of x, y, w, and h can be as high as 99, but the test cases go nowhere near that large. IMO there's no reason to have this problem so limited: make some test cases with explosive values! How about numbers up to 50,000? Or a million? :)\n- C# comes with a Rectangle class that does the math of this problem for you.",

    "content": "Nice idea.\nNote that the area can be computed as the sum of both areas minus the area of the intersection and that the intersection is the rectangle [ max(x1,x2), min(x1+w1,x2+w2) [ x [the same for y[ (where [a,b[ is {a,a+1,...,b-1} if a<b and the empty set otherwise). Hence there is a O(1) formula (instead of your O(n^2) solution).",
