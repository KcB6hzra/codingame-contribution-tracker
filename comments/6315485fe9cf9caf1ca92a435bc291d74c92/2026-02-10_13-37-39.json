    "content": "I have below suggestions for rephrasing the statement.\n\n\"\"\"\nThe King is represented by K. The enemy piece is either Bishop (B), Knight (N), Rook (R) or Queen (Q). The empty positions are represented by {{_}}. There are only two pieces in the board: king and the enemy.\n\"\"\"\n\nIt would have been better if we can replace \"_\" with \".\" in the input and remove whitespaces between the characters.\n\nCan we remove \"Knight\" in this statement since the output is applicable for all types of enemies?\n\nIf a King is in any of those x positions relative to the Knight on the input diagram, then the answer is \"Check\", otherwise \"No Check\"",

Should still be an 'easy' puzzle, I believe. Might add a 'Medium' version where there are more than two enemy pieces if people are interested.",
