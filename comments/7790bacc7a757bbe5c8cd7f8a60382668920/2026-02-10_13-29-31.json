    "content": "I find the instructions, and in particular the sentence, \"You should remove at most two digits\" to be slightly ambiguous.  I initially took it to mean that the largest number possible is always within two digits of the given number.  (Perhaps conditional upon on its existence; i.e., if it does exist, then it can be found by removing at most two digits.)  Perhaps the instructions could merge that sentence with the previous one.  Personally, I would give an enumeration of the desired properties that the solution should have.  Something like: \"given a number, and a target divisor, D, create the largest number possible that:\n\n1. is divisible by D\n2. uses only digits from the given number\n3. uses each digit of the original number at most once\n4. uses the digits in the same order in which they appear in the given number\n5. leaves out at most two digits of the given number\"\n\nEven that still leaves some ambiguity.  For example, given an original number 555567, are we allowed to use more than one 5 in our solution?",
