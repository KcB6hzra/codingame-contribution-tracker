    "content": "This is a great contribution. The problem is simple to grasp, yet it offers room for optimization, which adds to its challenge. I noticed that you've already used an efficient approach in the solution, which is great to see.\n\nThat said, I’d still suggest including a test case that pushes for optimization — like a 1×1 matrix with a large number. Such a case in the tests or validator would help ensure that brute-force solutions (like repeated -1 operations) don’t slip through and encourage coders to think in terms of bulk subtraction or your method.\n\nThank You.",
