When it comes to parsing input, that fact is not important (hat’s why I did not list in in the input section). What’s important when it comes to input parsing is that 80% is represented in the input as \"80\", not \"80%\" or \"0.8\".",

The large test case will confirm that it is indeed a workable approach.\n\nIn the Large Test Case 2, if you round the resulting percentage to the nearest integer, you will find that there are 329,467 different (U, D) values that resulted in S = 9884 and  R = 51%.
