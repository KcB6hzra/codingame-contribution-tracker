Gravity Tumbler is actually even easier, but since it doesn't show at first sight it makes for a fun problem.\n\nIn case you're wondering, I'm aware:\n- it's 2-periodic. But SRSLY it's not going to add much to have crazy big iteration counts.\n- I could add a third value by allowing null counts. Not much of interest here either.",
