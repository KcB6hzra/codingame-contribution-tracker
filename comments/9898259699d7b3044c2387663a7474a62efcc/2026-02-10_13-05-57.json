I would recommend removing the first 3 paragraphs and replacing it with an introduction that's a lot simpler to read in Clash of Code.  Technically, all the coder needs to do is calculate the current score of the white player.  It has nothing to do with AI, and any mention of AI should probably be removed from the Goal for clarity",

    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: Good clash, easy to solve in 5 minutes even for non-Chess players I would think. Not suitable for Reverse, but it seems it's been disabled based on a comment thread below (can't currently see clash information due to a site-wide glitch, but can use IDE).\n\nThe addition of the condition for the evaluation to be 0 if the king isn't on the board and the extra point for the bishop pair are nice differentiators to make this puzzle original. Simplifying the problem to only the White pieces balances out the extra work.",

    "content": "- Thanks, added \"per player\".\n\n- The generated stub is a big hint for the Reverse mode, and also I included one test case per piece type.\n\nBut maybe I should separate this into two submissions: this one without the reverse mode, and a simpler one just for the reverse mode?\n\nBy \"simpler\" I mean without the king and bishop-pair rules, and simpler testcases (starting with a testcase with just one pawn, then just one knight, then just one bishop, etc)",

Or, maybe something like this:\n\njust one pawn,\njust one knight,\none pawn + one knight,\none pawn + one knight + one bishop\netc.\n\nFor the current clash, it seems better to disable Reverse mode.",
