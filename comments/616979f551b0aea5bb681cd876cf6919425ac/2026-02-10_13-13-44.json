It always takes me a bit of time to get the code for primes together (ah, I see in Ruby you just have 'primes' - but I do not know about such a thing for Python), then I need to think about an algorithm for getting the right powers, then some small errors, and then (just now) I run into my solution timing out at test & validator 4 so I would need to check for optimization of my code. For me it feels a tad too difficult for a clash. It might make for a nice easy puzzle.\n\nCompliments on the explanation and visualization in the statement by the way, and, again, a very nice puzzle. I'd love to spend more than 5 minutes on this one :-).",

(EDIT: wrong. Actually up to 3203. Digits up to nine just means no prime divides the number more than 9 times).\n\nSo, for each digit in your answer you can just test how many times that prime divides the number. You can even go right to left starting with 23 if you want and just trim the leading zeros.\n\nSo if you just make an array of the 9 primes from 2 to 23 and then map that into an array of how many times each number divides the input then those become the new digits. :)",

I mixed those two up: I thought that this constraint phrase meant the same as what you state in the statement.\n\nActually, I still do not understand the way you have phrased the constraint. 'No digits in the prime-ary number will exceed 9' sounds to me that you will have, with a three-digit-length prime-ary, maximum 999 (and never 10 10 10 so to say). But if instead you mean to say that only the first 9 primes (prime 1 up to 9, i.e.  up to 23) are used, then instead that implies that 'The prime-ary number will always consist out of maximum 9 digits' (i.e. your highest prime-ary will be 999999999, max 9 characters).\nSo, if I understand it correctly, you actually have two different constraints (while you only mention one):\n- No digits in the prime-ary number will exceed 9;\n- The prime-ary number will exist out of maximum 9 digits.",
