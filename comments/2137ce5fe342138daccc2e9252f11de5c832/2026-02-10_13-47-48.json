This phrase \"contain an anagram\" suggests heavily that the strings must contain a consecutive set of letters that form anagram, while the opposite information is hidden in the example which may be skipped while reading the problem description fast. I'd suggest emphasizing it a bit more in the description.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "Anagram means literally swapping the letters around- so like \"was\" and \"saw\". The word \"wassaw\" would not be an anagram of \"saw\". Anagrams should have the same length, and same amount of each letter.\n\nAlso, even by your own rules, I don't see how the example has two outputs.\nAALGORITHN, algorithmics, and beMithorgal all contain a letter not in the input (n,c, and b respectively), so how could the output be 2?\n\nEdit 1: I like the puzzle, and will accept it when it is explained better. I did some thinking and realized you're looking for how much of the LINES are in w, not how much of the w is in LINES.\nEdit 2: Well, nope, I tested my theory and it doesn't work out that way. Not sure what the pattern really is.",
