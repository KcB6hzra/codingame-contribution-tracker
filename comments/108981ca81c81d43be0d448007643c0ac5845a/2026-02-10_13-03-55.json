Nice build-up of cases, with first L and S at start and end, then not, and finally L and S reversed. In this also tests and validators are balanced.\n\nSome minor language remarks (not harming the clash, so I could already approve):\n- 'Luffy *wants* to (...) and he *wants* to know how much time *it will take him* to reach there.'\n- 'A string path is given that *shows* Luffy's position (...)'\nOutput\n- 'An integer that *shows* the (...)'\n\nAnd, for constraints you could also say '3 ≤ length of path ≤ 100', to not let people worry about the possibility of encountering \"LS\" and what the output should be then.",
