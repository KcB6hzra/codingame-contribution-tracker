    "content": "There are no Constraints on the price itself. More than that, there are text that suggests the false constrain: \"Each character is separated by a space\". That kinda says that price can only be one character. And tests do not contradict that, only one validator does.\n\nSo you need to add a two-digit price to test 4. Until you do that puzzle is lowkey broken. Adding explicit constraints for the prices would be cool too.\n\nOtherwise, very cool. Seems to have a perfect difficulty at least for js (I can't really speak for other languages).",

Just a few suggestions (but I'm not 100% about these). 1) is that charCount really needed (at least in some languages)? 2) to me it would make more sense to have line 2 and line 3 swapped - first build a price list, then compute the total price (but again, not sure if this makes it harder/impossible for some languages). Great idea!",
