    "content": "This is a cool clash, and the optimisation part makes it quite fun.\n\nOne missing edge case though is a situation like \"No, we can't\" where one of the three is much less populous than the other two, but where after that one dies, the final winner is not actually the animal with the highest population at the point the third one dies.\n\nI managed to get 100% by simply subtracting the (minimum population - 1) from all three and then adding a clause to my while loop to stop after 1000 iterations. My while loop would have timed out otherwise, because I'd not optimised for situations where the three populations were drastically different, but I got lucky because I still got the right answer since the population that died first was the predator for the winner, so the remaining loops didn't change the answer (since I just picked the max population as the winner at the end).\n\nA test case that I would have failed would be a situation where after the first population goes extinct, its prey actually has the next lowest population. This means that the prey would be the predator of the animal with the largest population, and could just keep killing them until they died.\n\n\ne.g.\nCHICKENS 98765432\n    SNAKES 987654321\n       FOXES 9876543\n\nMy code would answer \"SNAKES 977776780\", but the correct answer should be \"CHICKENS 88888890\".",

There are enough chickens to kill all 3 snakes.\n=> 5 chickens, 0 snakes, 4 foxes\n\nTurn 1.2: Snakes kill foxes. There are no snakes, so all foxes remain.\n=> 5 chickens, 0 snakes, 4 foxes\n\nTurn 1.3: Foxes kill chickens. Chickens outnumber foxes, so only 4 chickens are killed.\n=> 1 chicken, 0 snakes, 4 foxes\n\nTurn 2.1: Chickens kill snakes. There are no snakes to kill.\n=> 1 chicken, 0 snakes, 4 foxes\n\nTurn 2.2: Snakes kill foxes. There are no snakes, so all foxes remain.\n=> 1 chicken, 0 snakes, 4 foxes\n\nTurn 2.3: Foxes kill chickens. There are enough foxes to kill the remaining chicken.\n=> 0 chickens, 0 snakes, 4 foxes.\n\nHence, 4 foxes remain (vs your answer: 2 foxes).\n\n* I'll try to respond to your earlier comment if I can, after the above is clarified.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "Hi.\n\nAt first I thought this might be too easy even for a CoC but it turned out to be trickier than it seemed, specially if big numbers are involved.\n\nWith small numbers, it can be solved with a naive algorithm that simulates each kill.\n\nIf big numbers are roughly equals, like in validator 8 \"Yes, we can\", the naive algorithm can be easily optimized to handle the case.\n\nBut if the big numbers are very different, the naive algorithm will always time out. For validator 9 \"No we can't\" another logic must be implemented, with a couple of tricky cases.\n\nI am wondering if it is ok for a CoC or if I should remove validator 9.\nOr should I keep it but make this an easy puzzle instead ? Or can I do both ?\n\nWhat about validator 8 ? It seems to me ok for a CoC. \nI could also add a validator with the value 0 for one or two animals, that might not be too hard to pass either.\n\nLet me know what you think and thanks for the feedback.",
