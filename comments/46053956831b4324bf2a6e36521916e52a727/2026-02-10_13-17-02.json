For the future try making this into a hard problem: The original string has length of at most 100.000, there are at most 100.000 string in the array of words and the sum of lengths of words is at most 200.000. This problem is solvable with dynamic programming and hashes. One key observation is that in those words there are at most an order of O(sqrt(SumLength))  different string lengths. The whole puzzle would be pretty hard to solve. For now the problem in this state is nice and unique.",
