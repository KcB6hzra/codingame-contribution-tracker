Better just output index of final pivot first, then tallies.",

The only IMO reference you need keep is \"This puzzle is a constructive implementation of the windmill process described in International Mathematical Olympiad 2011 problem B.

    "content": "Yes, you start at the pivot 0 and directly you intersect the point 1 so there is a change to point=1. Then the standard rotation occurs. I was thinking to turn slightly the rectangle to avoid this alignment but I think it still makes sense to have this special case ? This is the same for the validator btw but the rotation is inside the rectangle instead of outside. I can provide plots if it makes things clearer (just let me know)",
