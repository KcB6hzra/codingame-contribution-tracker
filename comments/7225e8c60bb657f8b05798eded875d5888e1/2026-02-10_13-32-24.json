If I understand correctly, the three sets are:\n1 2 1 => #1 wins\n0 2 2 1 => #2 wins\n2 1 1 => #1 wins\n#1 wins 2-1\n\nI was able to figure it out after seeing that Test case #2 has only 5 inputs instead of the naively-expected 9. Consider swapping these two cases, and remove tie games from the Test #2 validator.\n\nClose Call looks correct to me. Close Call #2 should have a lot more tie games so that it looks more like its validator.\n\nEDIT: Ignore the following\nAnd finally, as Frontier also mentioned, it's a silly coincidence that the final winner of a game is also the winner of the match. Should be an easy  but necessary fix.",
