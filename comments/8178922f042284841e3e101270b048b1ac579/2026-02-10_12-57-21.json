(See formatting syntax here: https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/statement#guidelines .)\n\n* Consider adding a simple example for each of \"sa\", \"ra\" and \"rra\" to make their behaviour easier to understand.\n\n* Please explain how to choose between multiple valid instruction sequences when alternatives exist.\n\n  Example 1: For input 2 1 3, all of the following are valid:\n  • sa\n  • rra + sa + rra\n  • ra + sa + ra\n  • ra + rra + sa\n\n  Example 2: For input 1 3 2, the following are valid:\n  • sa + ra\n  • rra + sa\n\nInput\n* Please delete the example and rewrite as:\n\n<<Line 1>>: Three space-separated integers, [[a]], [[b]] and [[c]], representing the elements of a stack.\n\nOutput\n* Please change \"Output the\" to \"<<One or more lines>>: The\".\n\n* Please format \"sorted\" as a {{constant}}.\n\nConstraints\n* Please rewrite the first constraint as:\n[[a]], [[b]] and [[c]] are all distinct.\n\n* Please delete the last three constraints, as they're part of the task or output requirement, rather than constraints on case possibilities.\n\n* Please add:\n0 ≤ [[a]], [[b]], [[c]] ≤ 10000\n\nCases\n* Each test and its validator should cover the *same* scenario with slightly different inputs. Please revise the cases accordingly.\n\n  For example, the first test and the first validator use \"sa\" only, and the second pair uses \"ra\" only, and so on.\n  \n* Also, the magnitudes of [[a]], [[b]] and [[c]] within each test/validator pair should be similar.\n\n* Please use a more diverse set of values across the full allowed range of 0 to 10000 when constructing inputs.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "Thank you for following up. The contribution looks better now. Just a few more adjustments:\n\nGoal\n* Please format \"sorted\" and \"multiple minimal solutions exist\" as {{constants}}.\n\nCases\n* Please reduce the frequency of using 1, 2, 3 as stack elements by revising the following tests, so that players understand other numbers can appear:\n\n  • AlreadySorted (Test 2)\n  \n  • SwapAndReverseRotate (Test 6)\n\n* The answer to SwapAndReverseRotate (Test 6 and Validator 6) should be \"multiple minimal solutions exist\", because sa + rra and ra + sa are both valid shortest solutions.\n\nOutput\n* Please change \"One or more lines\" to \"Line 1\", since the output will never contain more than one line.\n\nThanks again.",
