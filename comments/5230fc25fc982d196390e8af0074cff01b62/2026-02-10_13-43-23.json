    "content": "\"I don't think giving hints is really in the spirit of Clash of Code though.\"\n\nIf the problem was easy, I agree. But this is different. The hints (which hardly reveal anything btw) are in the spirit of clash if the problem is too hard for the AVERAGE player to finish in 5 minutes which is what  Clash of Code is really about. You're 1st place in clash so of course you wouldn't like it but the average to below average player would.\n\nI'm in the 2,000th rank area in clash which I believe is slightly above average and the problem took me the full 15 minutes to come up with a solution. You can just say I'm bad and you would be right, but it stands that clash is primarily built for players around my skill level and not for the people posting in this thread (highly ranked clashers).\n\nI also think that if \"Possibly helpful info if you're struggling:\" was instead titled \"Things to consider:\", you would not have said anything. Which suggests that your issue is emotional not logical. The content is not the problem, you just don't like how it makes you feel. That's why you used the word \"spirit\" . And I don't think emotional reasons carry weight here. In that case, I'll just reword it.",

I did some tweaks to make the content more easily readable.\n\nAlso, while \"Possibly helpful info if you're struggling\" might seem strange to read, its (1) more honest & (2) not confusing for readers.\n\nIt basically tells really good coders who understand the problem that they can ignore the paragraph and not waste their time. Certain coders might be even MORE confused after reading the last paragraph, so the statement \"possibly helpful\" lets them know they can ignore the information if they want to.",

    "content": "\"And I think that editing the statement without asking even after I accepted almost all of your suggestions (adapting to a way that I think is more legible) wasn't very nice, even that I know that you made it with good intentions.\"\n\nYeah my intentions were good, no harm meant and I'm sorry there was a disconnect. I didn't want to make you feel that way.\n\nOn that topic, maybe you disagree with me here, but since all \"experienced\" clashers have edit privileges and any of them can edit...I assume that the way this works is like a Wikipedia article. As soon as you write up a Wiki article, you no longer own it. You forfeit all ownership to the community. So therefore, I should be allowed to edit the problem description (only making responsible changes that I strongly consider direct improvements). Of course, in the worst case scenario that I'm being stupid, anyone can just fix it. So it works out. If I need your permission first, its actually a dictatorship right? Does that make sense?\n\n\"In my opinion the example with 4 days that results in a maximum of 3 simultaneous weekdays is more helpful, since it's kinda obvious that there are cases where 4 days can simultaneously fall on weekdays, but I left both there anyway.\"\n\nI like your change. I understand you'd like to remove my example, but I propose a compromise that I think you'll like. We remove my example completely, but we add one more sentence to your example like so:\n\n```\nTaking the days  {{1}}, {{3}}, {{5}}, {{6}} as an example, at least one day will always fall on a weekend, regardless of which day of the week Jan 1st falls on (so expected answer would be 3). E.g. One possibility is Jan 1st falling on a Friday, making days  {{1}}, {{3}}, {{5}}, {{6}} fall on Friday, Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday respectively.\n```",
