    "content": "Nice clash, but it's a bit hard to understand.\n\nThe biggest issue that I think needs to be clarified is that you say \"Lastly for each of the given numbers, add it to the result if that number is in the string version of result (for example 5 is in 258 so 263).\"\nBut then you don't explain which result to use (e.g.) for the second number if the result increased after the first number. For example if the result was 258 and the first number was 5, then the result is now 263, then if the next number is 3, it's unclear whether to add it now, since 3 is in \"263\" but not in \"258\".\nWhat your code and solutions assume is that the result before the numbers are added is what the numbers should be compared to, but in my clash I assumed that it would be iterative and got stuck for a short time trying to debug this.\n\nThat's the other problem with the clash, because there are so many steps, it's very hard to debug where something went wrong. It would be better to not jump so quickly to such complicated test cases. \"qwerty\" would be a good early test, rather than starting with \"Hello World!\", for example.\n\nOverall, it's fun but I think it's quite hard to understand and debug, and it would be good to clarify how the adding of numbers is dependent on the initial value of the result before any numbers are added. I came first in my Fastest mode clash, with 2 bots getting 100%, then all 3 human players getting 0%. :/\n\nhttps://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/380137387544b3df0fd170851a901616d51e6d0",
