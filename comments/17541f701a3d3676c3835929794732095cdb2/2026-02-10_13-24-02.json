(After the edit stated above, there were only 1 False and 5 True for the validators.)",

Additionally, it's different than normal puzzles as it's a mixture of [], {}, and (). However, this is () alone. Definitely wanna see more of these types of clashes in the future!",

The algorithm is not very difficult but needs reflexion to be created what is a good thing. I really like the fact that many solutions can be found to the same problem and make this one very interesting.",

This should (I believe) be added to match your code, as currently simply checking that the number of each type of parenthesis is equal is enough to solve it...  \n- What should be the output in case there is an other character than \")\" or \"(\"? \n- I feel like this could be fun in shortest as well. \n\nPersonnal code with the current tests and validators (so not taking order of parenthesis into account), in Python: \n\nx=lambda y:(y==\"(\")-.5\nprint(sum(map(x,input()))==0)",
