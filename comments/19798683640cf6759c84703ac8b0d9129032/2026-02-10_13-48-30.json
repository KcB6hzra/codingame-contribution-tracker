    "content": "Stilgart,\n\n    Thanks for the feedback.  I reworded the problem as you suggested after taking a look at your example and added some bolded line indicators for input and output.  Hopefully, this is a little better.  I also removed this from the fastest mode.\n\n    I'm hoping you could clarify the part about the validators being similar to the tests.  This is a bit ambiguous for me.  For instance, the test for Positives and the validator More Positives both test positive values.  While they contain a different number of positive values to test they both test positive values.  I would say they are similar in this regard.  User Unihedron made this same suggestion so I would like to know what is acceptable before I attempt making more difficult challenges.\n\nThank you!",

    "content": "Thanks. The statement is in a really good shape now.\n\nThe issue with your validators is their size. They are 5 to 10 times bigger than their corresponding tests. While this may seem irrelevant for this puzzle, you can never know what people will do, especially in reverse mode. One can design an extremely slow (but shorter) solution, that will pass all the tests but fail the validators because of a timeout.\nTherefore, the rule is to have each validator of almost the same size as its corresponding test.\n\nWhen the puzzle is prone to timeouts and you have a test/validator with a large input, it is also recommanded to put the more time-consuming input as the test, and the other as the validator. Then, if a code pass all the tests, it will also pass all the validators.",
