I humbly propose consolidating paragraphs 1 and 3 of the directions as follows:\n\nYou are given the [[answer]] to today's <<Wordle>> and a list of [[N]] [[attempt]]s to solve it.\nFor each [[attempt]], you must print 5 characters corresponding to the 5 letters of [[attempt]] consisting of:\n- the character <<#>> if the letter is at the right place\n- the character <<O>> if the letter is in [[answer]] but at another place (additionally: if there are <<a>> occurrences of the letter in incorrect places in [[attempt]] and <<b>> occurrences of the letter in incorrect places in [[answer]], only the first <<min(a,b)>> occurrences of the letter going from left to right that are in incorrect places in [[attempt]] should be assigned the character <<O>>)    \n- the character <<X>> for all other cases\n\nThanks!",
