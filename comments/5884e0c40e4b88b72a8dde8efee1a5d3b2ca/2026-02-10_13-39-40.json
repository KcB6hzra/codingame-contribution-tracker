But let's look further.\n\n- Test 4 : size = 10 -> trunk = 2\nThe trunk part cannot be 1/3 and 1/4. So it's 1/5.\n\n- Test 6 : size = 12 -> trunk = 3\n- Test 7 : size = 20 -> trunk = 4\nThoses cases confirm 1/5 is the good solution.\n\nDo you agree with my explanations ?\nAnyway, I thank you for your feedback :)",

    "content": "Please don't get this wrong because I'm trying to indicate what's the problem with this in reverse. I'm also stating that in non-reverse modes it's perfectly valid.\n\nYou say that you get that the trunk is 1/5th of the incoming parameter (N) by deduction. The thing you forget is you deduced this by knowing the problem and the fact that you have preliminary knowledge that it is a proportion of N. But almost everyone playing clash who gets this problem as reverse hasn't. So they have to first guess it's proportionally related to N.\n\nAlso the result is actually ceiling(N / 5) and that's surprising. I have used the floor function thousands of times in my life but the ceil function only a few times. It's generally more natural to take the integer part of a decimal number as opposed to rounding it up. My first guess was floor(N / 4) + 1. But someone else might have associated to something else than division like some relationship to the Fibonacci series or whatever.\n\nMy problem was that the number of test cases showed that effort was put into the problem, probably several revisions and the top part is clearly very simple (logically) but the button part contains some trick. And that's when I get worried because I had seen so many bad examples in the past. Couple years ago I solved a problem where everyone got 80%, it had at least 3 different solutions, so I looked up what was the correct and it was some insane logic no human would have ever guessed. And it feels bad when you don't solve the problem but you guess it and do a leap of faith submit.\n\nWith that said, I don't think you should delete Reverse mode, and I don't know what can be changed, I just wanted to surface that most people solve problems without prior knowledge and that's what makes reverse really hard.",
