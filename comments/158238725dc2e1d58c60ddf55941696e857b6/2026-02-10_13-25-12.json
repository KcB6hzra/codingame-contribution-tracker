    "content": "Nice clash, but I noted a couple of issues.\n\n1. You don't mention in the statement what would happen if  the current date \"U\" was 15. Your solution code wouldn't include any money from this paycheck in the calculation, but since there are no tests with this edge case it doesn't really make a difference. The issue is just that clashers don't know how to handle it if it comes up in validators, so might waste time unsure of what to code it as. You could specify [[U]] is never 15 in the constraints, perhaps? That would remove the concern.\n\n2. I got this in a Shortest mode clash and someone submitted the below Ruby code and got 100% even though it's an incorrect solution and doesn't even consider the current date \"U\" or that there are 30 days in a month:\nd,x,t,u=gets.split.map(&:to_i);e=d*(t/15)\nputs e>0?e>=x ? true : false : \"ruined\"\n\nThis shows that your tests/validators aren't sufficient to weed out incorrect solutions. Part of the issue is the \"almost\" binary output, so even if the calculations are wrong there's at worst a 50-50 chance of getting the right answer mostly.\n\nA test case that would fail for that code above would be any with t < 15 that gives true as the answer.\ne.g.\n1000 700 14 3 => true\n1300 1000 4 13 => true",
