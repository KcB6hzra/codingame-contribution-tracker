But maybe I'm just missing something obvious (don't tell me ^^)\n\nBut anyway, your example is not complete. You show how it is possible  to get an imbalance of 2, but you do not show that it is the minimal possible value. So you actually show that the minimal imbalance is _at most_ 2. I suggest you explain why this is the minimal value.",

    "content": "The Easy rating seems generous or I don't understand levelling. I've read the description quite a few times and am still a bit confused. In the example the second action \"2 x first column\" -- which I take to mean increase the values in the first column by 2... wouldn't the imbalance be the same if you increased by 1... i.e. 3-1=2. So the second increase to (4-2) and fourth matrix displayed isn't really necessary? Maybe I'm still not understanding something because when I look at Validator 1 (9870) it looks like the output should be 6... since 9-3=6 which seems like the best you can achieve? (9993)",

    "content": "I really enjoyed this challenge, but, implementing a simple recursive \"imbalance descent\" in python led to maximum recursion depth reached from test 6 ...\nSo, with matrix elements being smaller than 10^6 I think in is quite simple. But after that, some optimization is required no ?\nWhile trying to solve it, I was like \"My goodness, is there a simple mathematical solution I am missing, like, using a determinant or something?\" but I couldn't figure out.\nSo unless there is a nice optimization trick to think about, or a mathematical shortcut, I think tests after level 5 go to too large numbers. Of course, it could be possible to use a dirty trick like enlarging steps when the imbalance is large, but nothing tells us it has to eventually converge to reasonably small imbalance so, this type of solution wouldn't be good in my opinion, unless there is a good criterion to know whether the steps should be coarse or fine.\nThis problem of maximum recursion depth is certainly language-dependant and for sure Python isn't the best for that, but unless I miss something, such large numbers of required steps don't add any interest to the challenge, do they?",
