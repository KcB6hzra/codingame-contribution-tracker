    "content": "I assume the tasks aren't all formatted fully due to the word limit imposed by the CodinGame statement editor, so I won't comment on that for now.\n\nMy impression of this puzzle is that there seems to be a lot to do, but very few (if not none) of the tasks actually carry any difficulty. In fact, I think this could be a Medium puzzle the way it's currently set up. This is my evaluation of each of the tasks so far:\n\n- GRAPH: there is no \"shortest\" path to evaluate; there is only one path in each test case, and each path involves all edges. Graph algorithms such as Dijkstra is not required here.\n\n- ITEMS: standard 0/1 knapsack, unfortunately I think it's brute-forceable due to the small number of items given. The variable names \"w\" and \"v\" may not be friendly to those unfamiliar with the knapsack algorithm.\n\n- GUARDS: seems to be a simulation exercise involving at most one guard (at least for most of the test cases, correct me if I'm wrong). A Manhattan distance of >1 seems to be too restrictive of a condition as most loops will terminate immediately / after just a few iterations.\n\n- SAFE: this one is quite interesting, worth keeping.\n\n- PATTERN: this one is resistant to brute-force even for a small number of candidates and is worth keeping. Edit distance might not be friendly to those unfamiliar with the definition, but it's easily google-able.\n\n- HIERARCHY: some test cases (e.g. \"Golden Spiral\", \"Final Meltdown\") do not fulfil the required P>C format. Long chains of consecutive P>C end up pointing to the very first element being the root node (I assume \"P\" means parent and \"C\" means child).\n\n- BINARY: simple XOR reduction and built-in bit counter will easily solve this task, not worth keeping.\n\n- FACTOR: worth keeping. Here \"multiplicity\" might not be friendly and may potentially be confusing; see: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2029838/is-there-a-name-notation-for-the-sum-of-the-powers-in-a-prime-factorization.\n\n- WORDS: simple sorting task, not worth keeping.\n\n- SECRET: simple encoding task, not worth keeping.\n\n- NUMS: simple GCD/LCM reduction, not worth keeping.\n\n- FIB: simple, but may be worth keeping I suppose.\n\n- PALSTR: worth keeping; but again, will need inputs of much longer length to avoid brute-force algorithms.\n\n- ROMAN: simple but I think it's worth keeping.\n\n- RLE: simple, not worth keeping UNLESS the original decoded string is meant to contain digits as well (for example, check my clash of code: https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1410576a3b7d8c27061b17d991e7afd80354a4)\n\n- ANAGRAM: simple counting exercise, not worth keeping.\n\n- BRACKETS: simple stack solution; I guess it's worth keeping. But the only test cases worth considering are few (e.g. \"Network Infiltration\", \"Number Theory Storm\"); the rest of the test cases contain trivial versions of the problem.",

    "content": "General\n* The variety of tasks is overwhelming. While the story provides a thematic wrapper, it mostly connects a set of otherwise unrelated mini-problems and feels somewhat bolted on. It may be better to let each task stand on its own as an independent puzzle rather than framing them as parts of a single narrative sequence.\n\nDifficulty\n* As solving this problem requires familiarity with a wide range of algorithms and techniques, the overall difficulty should be classified as Hard or Very Hard.\n\nGoal\n* The term \"Phase\" is potentially misleading. It suggests a sequential dependency where the output of one phase becomes the input of the next. In reality, after DECODE and PARSE, the remaining tasks are largely independent computations whose results are only combined at the end.\nPlease avoid the word \"Phase\" where this dependency does not exist, and clarify explicitly that most tasks are independent.\n\n* The purpose and output of Phase 2 (PARSE) are not clearly connected to the subsequent tasks. It should be stated explicitly that all later tasks read their inputs directly from the parsed key–value data.\n\n* Several input specifications are unclear or underspecified. For example,\n\n  • Some delimiters are not stated.\n\n  • Some text isn't formatted as [[variables]] or {{constants}} for easy identification.\n  \n  • The expression [[x mod M = R]] is written like a single variable name, which is confusing.\n\n  • The meanings of some variables aren't defined.\n\n  • The input formats aren't always specified (e.g. TX and TY).\n\n* Phase 4 (GRID): The purpose of this task is unclear and seems disconnected from the rest. Please clarify the intent or consider removing it.\n\n* Phase 6 (GUARDS): The coordinate system isn't defined. For example, does moving U increase or decrease the y-coordinate?\n\n* Phase 12 (SORT): If the number of words N is even, how is the \"middle\" word defined?\n\n* Phases 14 & 15: Abbreviations (GCD and LCM) should be accompanied by their full names.\n\n* Phase 19 (RLE): Is every character of the original (uncompressed) string guaranteed to be a non-digit character? Is every character guaranteed to have a preceding count? Are multi-digit counts allowed?\n\n* Phase 26 (REVERSE): How is a \"word\" defined? Are words always space-delimited? How should punctuation or multiple spaces (if any) be handled?\n\nConstraints\n* The stated maximum encoded input length (12000) exceeds CG's limit (10000), and the actual test inputs never contain more than 2000 characters. Please update the constraint to 2000 to reflect realistic limits.\n\nStub generator\n* Please change 12000 to 2000 for the reason stated above.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "General\n* My original comment still stands. The puzzle feels like a collection of otherwise unrelated mini-problems loosely tied together by a thin narrative wrapper. As written, it still reads like: \"Here are several classic algorithms to solve, and there happens to be a story.\" It's better to let each task stand on its own as an independent puzzle.\n\n* The tasks are underspecified and need more detailed descriptions. The character limit is 5000, while the current statement is only ~1700 characters, so there is ample room to expand the statement. (There will be even more room if some tasks are removed; see below.) You can also use the Input section to provide more details on inputs (also see below).\n\n* I strongly recommend switching the puzzle to WIP status for now to avoid accidental approval or rejection. Significant revisions are needed, and it'd be best to refine everything before publication.\n\nExisting puzzles\n* Consider removing the following tasks. Standalone puzzles with the same or similar tasks already exist.\n\n  • {{SAFE}} https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/remainder-fantasy\n\n  • {{PALSTR}} https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/longest-palindrome\n\n  • {{BRACKETS}} https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/brackets-extreme-edition , https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/valid-brackets-in-code\n\n  • {{LUHN}} https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/credit-card-verifier-luhns-algorithm\n\nDifficulty\n* The overall difficulty should be classified as Hard, as the problem still assumes familiarity with multiple algorithms and techniques, and the effort required exceeds that of a typical Medium puzzle.\n\nGoal\n* Please add \"Each line corresponds to one task.\"\n\n* Please move all constraints into the Constraints section.\n\n* Please assign every parameter a name and format it as a [[variable]].\n\n* GRAPH: Please format \"-\", \":\", \"S\" and \"E\" as {{constants}}.\n\n* FINAL: Please format \"PATTERN\" as a {{constant}}.\n\n* FIB: The word \"Fibonacci\" is missing in the description.\n\n* Please rewrite all unclear or abbreviated descriptions using complete sentences, including but not limited to:\n\n  • ITEMS: Please expand \"Solve 0/1 Knapsack\".\n\n  • GUARDS: Please replace \"T\" with \"time\" or define it clearly. Please state the time required for each move.\n\nInput\n* For every task, please clearly describe each variable's type and meaning. For example (illustrative only):\n\n{{GRAPH}}:\nFor each edge:\n• [[A]] and [[B]]: Single-letter labels for the two vertices.\n• [[W]]: Integer for edge weight.\n\nConstraints\n* Please specify constraints for every task.\n\n* Please show the task name before the corresponding task-specific constraints. For example,\n\n{{GRAPH}}:\n• 1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 50\n• 1 ≤ number of edges ≤ 200\n• ??? ≤ [[W]] ≤ ??? (fill in the bounds)\n• {{S}} and {{E}} are guaranteed to exist and be connected.\n\nCases\n* Omega (Test 6): Please remove the trailing newline from the output.\n\n* I'll further review the cases once the above issues have been addressed.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "General\n* May I once again suggest considering splitting the individual tasks into separate puzzles?\n\nAs the puzzle grows more complex, it naturally becomes harder to manage and maintain consistent quality. There are many aspects to verify (my own case-checking script already exceeds 200 lines), and it's difficult to ensure clear progression in case difficulty. From a review perspective, it's also challenging to thoroughly validate everything and be fully confident that nothing has been missed.\n\nTask removal\n* Consider removing the PATTERN task as there's already an existing puzzle on Levenshtein distance: https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/levenshtein-distance\n\n* Consider removing the FACTOR task as there's already an existing clash with the same task: https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/396274fc9376e23154b061de0cc40db8143\n\n* Consider removing the EVAL and POWMOD tasks. These tasks may not meaningfully increase algorithmic depth in languages with built-in support.\n\nGoal\n* \"Each task below reads its own set of keys from this parsed data\": consider replacing \"reads\" and \"keys\" with \"uses\" and \"parameters\" respectively.\n\n* All task descriptions currently begin with \"The key\", but that's imprecise. For example, {{GRAPH}} is the key, but its associated value contains the actual data. Please revise the wording.\n\n* GRAPH: Please clarify what \"shortest\" means. Does it refer to the minimum number of edges or the minimum total path weight? Consider explicitly stating which value to consider and avoiding the word \"shortest\".\n\n* GUARDS: Please change \"a guard has\" to \"every guard has\".\n\n* EVAL: Please show the parentheses characters.\n\n* Step 4: Please format task names in <<bold>> instead of as {{constants}}. (The {{constant}} format is preserved for the [[KEYS]].)\n\nInput\n* Please add \"in the following order\" after \"KEY:VALUE\".\n\n* Please reformat task names in <<bold>> instead of as {{constants}}, and the keys as {{constants}} (see example below).\n\n* If a variable name is the same as a key, show them separately, e.g. {{TX}} and [[TX]].\n\n* For GRAPH, KNAPSACK and GUARDS, please rewrite the input descriptions for clarity. Example:\n\n<<GRAPH>>: {{GRAPH}} — comma-separated edges, each formatted as [[A]]{{-}}[[B]]{{:}}[[W]] (node names, integer weight).\n\n* Consider simplifying the input format by adopting a consistent delimiter rule, e.g.\n  • Always separate elements in [[VALUE]] using semicolons.\n  • Separate sub-elements using commas.\n  If such a convention is stated upfront, repeated explanations of delimiters can be removed from individual task descriptions (in both the Goal and Input sections).\n\n* KNAPSACK: Please state that [[WEIGHT]] and [[VALUE]] are integers.\n\n* GUARDS: Please state that [[GX]] and [[GY]] are integers.\n\n(character limit almost reached…)",

Cases that are structurally identical (e.g. containing the same graph or equivalent elements but differing only in naming or ordering) should be treated as duplicates.\n\n* Consider shuffling edges in the TOPO task across cases to prevent reliance on input order and improve robustness.\n\nThanks.",
