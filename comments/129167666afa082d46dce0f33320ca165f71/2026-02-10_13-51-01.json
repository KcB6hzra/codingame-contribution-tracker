Re-wording suggested to three paragraphs:\n\nImagine you have a bag, which contains N balls. Each ball is either black or white. You know that W balls are white.\n\nBalls once drawn are never put back into the bag.\n\nReduce the output ratios to the lowest terms. For example, reduce 2:4 to 1:2, and 6:15 to 2:5.\n\n(In my opinion, it is sufficient to explain the reduction of fractions and ratios by giving examples instead of mentioning common divisibility. And I would use the word \"divisible\" instead of \"dividable\".)\n\n3. You may consider to explain by showing all the possible combinations instead of showing the calculation, and let the players discover the calculation needed. For example,\n\nYou have 3 balls in the bag, 2 of which are white.\nYou draw 2 balls from the bag. What is the odds ratio of both drawn balls being white?\n\nIf you draw 2 balls from the bag, all the possible results are:\nBlack, White1\nBlack, White2\nWhite1, Black\nWhite1, White2\nWhite2, Black\nWhite2, White1\n\nP(A) = Probability of getting 2 white balls = 2/6\nP(!A) = Probability of not getting 2 white balls = 4/6\n\nSo the odds ratio P(A):P(!A) = (2/6):(4/6) = 2:4 = 1:2.",

Just write \"ratio\". In the constrain part state that the solution has to be simplified to integers as far as possible - that will convey your meaning clearly.",

The ratio is not the same thing as a fraction\n\n2:4 would be the same ratio and equally true as java_coffee_cup mentioned. So you need to divide 2 and 4 by their gcd (greatest common divisor) to reach the \"smallest\" ratio.\n\n\"The ratio 2:4 would be the same ratio, but both numbers are dividable by 2. So you need to reduce the fraction.\" [End of Example 1]\n\nI will change the name of the variable n if you really think it confuses people.\nIt's now an \"s\" for \"sample\" :)",

If this were my puzzle, I'd only mention it in the I/O section using some form of the word \"reducible\".\n\n\"ratio/fraction\" ok, I see the distinction you make. IMHO, it's exactly what I think is missing to make your puzzle understandable, since you define everything in terms of probability, and jump directly from \"the result is [fraction]\" to \"so output [something else]\". I suppose it's obvious to someone who's right out of game probability class, but for the rest of us it deserves some transition. \n\nNotice that your own text is contributing to conflating them: \"The *ratio* 2:4 would be [blah blah blah but] you need to reduce the *fraction*\"\n\nAbout n/N, yes I think it's got the potential to not be to helpful. I just noticed that in a way, it's slightly inconsistent as well, since the number of desired white balls could just as well be called w.\nI could add that in some languages, it's going to make the code generator generate unusable stubs, as both parameters are going to be merged.\nOh but I just noticed you already changed it. Thanks!\n\nI really don't think it's a hard problem. Past the ratio/probability thing, it's a straightforward counting problem, with a constant-time solution given the bounds on N.",
