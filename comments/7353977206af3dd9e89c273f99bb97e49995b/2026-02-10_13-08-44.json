And I block 6-7 minutes because I only read the first part of the sentence \"difference\", I thought it was : the set contains all single number contained by only one set.\n\nBut after reread the explanation I did in less of one minute.\n\n```js\nswitch (operation) {\n    case '+': answer(new Set([...set1, ...set2])); return\n    case '&': answer(set1.filter((a) => set2.indexOf(a) !== -1)); return\n    case '-': answer(set1.filter((a) => set2.indexOf(a) === -1)); return\n}\n```",

    "content": "Thanks.\n\nI understand the logic with changing symbols and at first I used \"*\" instead of \"&\", but I decided that in order for this to be solvable in Reverse I really wanted to use symbols that were easiest to decipher their meaning. \"&\" makes sense for intersections because it's got to be in set_1 and set_2. Then plus and minus are also just the natural choices. I think the small benefit to Ruby users is less of a big deal than obscuring the challenge to the point that Reverse is not fun anymore.\n\nAs for the statement in the stub, I mostly just can't stand the \"Auto-generated code...\" default text that takes up so much space. I always remove it for aesthetics when I clash, so I like to have a shorter statement in mine so that people can save time on removing it if they hate it too, haha.",

    "content": "Thanks, I left the \"{}\" in because it's the way that an empty set is represented in mathematics. I've changed the header now to just say who the author is, I mostly just want a header so that the long auto-generated one isn't there, because I personally find that one annoying and always spend time removing it to make my code nicer. I figure having the author in the code can help for Reverse mode where you sometimes want to find the clash afterwards and figure out what the solution was if you couldn't solve it in time. :)",
