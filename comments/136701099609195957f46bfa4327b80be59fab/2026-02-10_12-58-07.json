    "content": "Nice clash.\n\nOne tricky thing is that 'Christmas Shopping' has a unique quirk in that it has 'Wine' and 'MulledWine'.\n\nI got this in Shortest mode and was failing this test, but then got 100% on validators.\n\nI went for a RegEx solution that scraped the item name, and its price1 and price2 from LookAheads. But 'MulledWine' broke my lookahead logic and I couldn't figure it out in-clash.\n\nNot sure if you'd want to get rid of it (make the clash easier) or add a matching validator (make it harder), but thought I'd let you know.",
