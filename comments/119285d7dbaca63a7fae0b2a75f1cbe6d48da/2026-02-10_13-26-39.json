    "content": "First off, I like this puzzle.   You have my upvote.\n\nI had an issue, though, that caused me a lot of grief.  The statement says that '/' in the puzzle input indicates a spare.   However, it's also used to indicate that all pins are knocked down on roll 3 of a tenth-frame strike.   This is not really a spare, though, since there are no rolls to follow to complete a spare's score. \n\nIt seems to be accepted practice to put a / in a real 10th frame \"paper\" score, but I didn't know that and it's not in the statement.  What made it an issue for me is that this only appears in validators, not in any of the visible test cases.  I discarded two working solutions that passed all tests, but failed validators 3 and 4.  I eventually \"cheated\" and ran my third version through the \"Test in IDE\" here, where my issue quickly became apparent.\n\nMy suggestion is to change one of the test cases 3 or 4 to include a tenth frame like 'X9/' and maybe mention this in the statement.",
