    "content": "Minimum grammar fixes:\n\n1) Here are the 4 rules of killer sudoku.  (You are missing the word \"are\".)\n\n2) The cages are represented in a 9x9 grid with and identifier (the word \"and\" should be \"an\").\n\n3) Same sentence as #2 above - the word \"follow\" should be changed to \"follows\".\n\nRule number 4 is difficult to make grammatically correct with the nesting of possession - a cage has cells, the cells have values, the values have a sum.  I really don't know the proper way to fix that grammar and make the chain of possession clear.\n\nBecause I find rule #4 difficult to correct, I am choosing to repost my original suggestions for the goal section from 18 days ago:\n\nYou may know the sudoku puzzle. Killer sudoku adds a new rule with cages. A cage is a group of cells, the sum of which must equal the cage value. Numbers cannot repeat within cages.\n\nHere are the 4 rules of killer sudoku:\n1. Each row must have numbers from 1 to 9 with no repetition\n2. Each column must have numbers from 1 to 9 with no repetition\n3. Each region (3x3 square) must have numbers from 1 to 9 with no repetition\n4. Each cage's cell numbers must sum to the cage value, with no repetition among numbers\n\nIn the Input section: I don't think \"repartition\" is the word you are looking for.  I believe repartition is a verb meaning to partition something again or a noun meaning a second or additional dividing or distribution.  Using the words \"cage partitions\"  is probably what you are looking for.\n\nI need to think about the Input section.  It is difficult to read.",

    "content": "Nice job!  It never occurred to me to just brute force the entire thing no matter what.\n\nHere is some fun data comparing your solution to my solution on ONLY the first 7, which I am able to solve with zero backtracking.  Your time to solve is first.  My time to solve is second.  I'm having each of our algorithms do 20 iterations in the CG IDE and taking an average.  The only exception is #7 where I'm just doing an estimate across multiple submits because your algorithm only solves that problem one time within the time limit..\n\n1 - 0.3ms  vs  2ms\n2 - 0.59ms  vs  2ms\n3 - 0.88ms  vs 2.5ms\n4 - 0.83ms  vs 2.9ms\n5 - 57ms  vs  6ms\n6 - 111ms  vs  9.5ms\n7 - 3,800ms vs 32ms\n\nAs the puzzles get harder and harder, it looks like grid reduction becomes critical before doing any backtracking.  I was hoping the test cases would get hard enough to  engage that topic, but your solution proves that all 8 cases can be done within the 5000ms (I think) time limit strictly doing brute force backtracking.",

    "content": "You are correct.  For each of the 81 cells, you create a list of possible numbers.  Then through a process of elimination, you reduce those lists of possible numbers as much as you can.  For instance, if a cage has only 2 cells that must add up to 8, then you can eliminate 4 from both lists.  Why?  A cage cannot contain duplicate numbers so you can't have two 4s in the same cage.  You could also say that if your cage only has two cells, those two cells must be in the same row or the same column.  Then, once again, you can eliminate the 4 from each of the two cells' lists of possibilities because you can't have duplicate 4s in a row or column.  After that process is over, you might have a complete grid, but even if you don't, you have significantly reduced how much backtracking you must do.  What I think I need to do is either use your backtracking or switch my Algorithm X backtracking to Dancing Links (DLX).  My grid reduction is obviously helpful.  My backtracking is my slow part.\n\nHere's the bottom line.  I found the process of grid reduction incredibly challenging, and therefore, super fun.  For that reason, I'm not going to share my code.  I don't want to possibly deprive you of that experience.  And, because the author is so fast on Validator 4, I truly believe there might be something else I have missed in terms of grid reduction. Unfortunately, I don't know PHP, so the author's code is a bit overwhelming to me.\n\nI want this puzzle to be approved.  I'm also interested in exploring the idea of another puzzle that we might call Extreme Killer Sudoku where every test case and validator is extreme expert.  I'm wondering if there are Killer Sudoku puzzles that couldn't be solved within the time limit by backtracking alone.",
