    "content": "How did this get approved, when the Complex For Dwarf test (both the test and validation) fail to follow the Dwarf rules?\n\nIn test maze #5 (Warrior wins) the Dwarf is MUCH faster if he can change direction while breaking through a wall.  Since the Warrior wins that one, the Dwarf must be required to continue straight when breaking through a wall.  On top of which, anywhere the Dwarf did this could create multiple paths of identical length, which messes up the solution output.\n\nIn the test maze of Complex For Dwarf, the expected solution path (as shown on the Left here) changes direction while breaking a wall TWICE at (15,7) and (13,6).\nIt also goes through 3 walls in a row at (13,7)-(13,6)-(12,6) which explicitly breaks the \"thickness 1\" requirement.\n\nIn the validation maze of Complex For Dwarf, the expected solution path changes direction within a wall at (7,7) while going through 2 walls in a row (7,7)-(7,6).  If the path went up one more cell before going left it would be correct.",

I see you recently changed the difficulty to hard.  I thought it was a good medium level challenge.\n\nI'd like to make some very minor grammar and formatting edits.  I started writing it all out and I thought I'd just ask you instead.  May I have your permission to do some minor editing?\n\nExample: You capitalized all the bullets in the goal, but you only capitalized one bullet in the Rules.  I'd like to see all bullets capitalized.\n\nLet me know if you are okay with me doing some minor edits.  If not, I'll write everything in another comment.",
