    "content": "Like Timinator, I got a bit confused by the N and n, but ignoring the textual details and focusing on the general description it is a nice puzzle. And, the formula 'Fn = F(n-2) + F(n-3)' did help me in thinking up the solution.\n- The order of the sentences in the statement can be changed. The formula Fn = F(n-2) + F(n-3) is only correct if every pair of rabbits gives birth to one pair of rabbits, so that should be mentioned before the formula. I would suggest the following statement text: \"... the age (in years) the rabbits can reproduce. Each pair of rabbits will always give birth to one pair of rabbits per year of reproduction. For example, if rabbits can reproduce from the age of 2 to 3 years (inclusive), the number of rabbits born in year n (Fn) is the sum of the number of pairs two and three years before that year: Fn = F(n-2) + F(n-3).\n\nThe consistent use of rabbits vs pairs of rabbits is important. All numbers in this puzzle are about 'pairs of rabbits', so I suggest that you consistently talk about pairs.\n- 'you will have to calculate how many rabbits will be born' -> 'you will have to calculate how many pairs of rabbits will be born';\n- 'Those rabbits will always give birth to... -> 'Each pair of rabbits will always give birth to...'",

    "content": "I like this little puzzle a lot. However, the way you have chosen to demonstrate the Fibonacci relationship doesn’t work for me. Here’s why:\n\nFrom Goal:\n>> you will have to calculate how many rabbits will be born at a given moment\n\nInput Spec:\n>> and N, representing the number of years to simulate\n\nTo me, this all means that the “given moment” that needs to be calculated is “n” years into the future. I’m pretty sure you will agree with all of that. \n\nNow let’s look at test case 1. N=10, a=1, b=2. Re-writing this input per your example, gives us:\n\nF(n+2) = F(n+1) + F1\n\nI’m pretty sure you agree that to solve this test case we actually need to calculate F(10), right? How many pair of rabbits will be born on the 10th year after F1 is introduced into the system. \n\nThe way your formula is written above, I’m tempted to plug 10 in for “n” and try to calculate F(12). After all, the input told me n=10. Or maybe I’m confident that I need to solve for F(10), which leads me to believe N is actually 8 in your formula and them I’m just confused. \n\nFor me, this puzzle became very easy and straightforward when I quit looking at the example and I went back to the more common Fibonacci representation for test case 1:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\n\nThe number of rabbits born in the nth year after F1 is the sum of the number of rabbits that are one year old, and the number of rabbits that are two years old, per the given reproductive years.",

For example, in \"Birth Control\" Validator, the rabbits give birth every 3 time units, which means that there is one new generation every 3 time units. In other words, 1 time unit does not necessarily mean 1 generation.\n\nHence, assuming \"year\" is the time unit used, I would suggest to change \"generation 1\" to \"year 1\", and add \"(in years)\" after \"the age\".\n\n* Please mention the assumption that each pair of rabbits always gives birth to one pair each time.\n\n(Because, you know, if each pair of rabbits gives birth to 1 rabbit or 3 rabbits each time, the calculation is entirely different.)\n\nInput section\n* Please change \"Integer\" to \"space-separated integers\" (note the plural form).\n\n* Please change \"rabbit's pairs\" to \"pairs of rabbits\".\n\n* Please delete \"at F1\".
