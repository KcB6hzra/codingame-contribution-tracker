This may make it difficult for players using a non-QWERTY keyboard (or I dunno, maybe a \"non-standard\" QWERTY keyboard too, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Qwerty.svg ) doing the clash in Reverse mode. It's particularly an issue for the character 1c.\n\nEven a QWERTY keyboard user may not know what characters to include in their code because the tests do not cover them all.\n\nSuggest to *either* revise the cases so that the tests fully cover all the characters covered in the validators, *or* just disable Reverse mode.\n\nThanks.\n\nP.S. It would be nice if you could publish your future contributions as WIP for about a week first.",

But it helps to have all characters included in the test cases. Thanks for your help,",
