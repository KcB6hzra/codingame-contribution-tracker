    "content": "A nice easy puzzle.\n\nThe formatting of the time into HH:MM:SS feels like a random addition to the basic puzzle problem and might be unnecessary.\n\nYou mention briefly in the initial problem summary to round down seconds when printing the result. I think perhaps that should be restated in the detailed \"Output\" description.  In my initial solution, I assumed that seconds should be rounded up to a whole number of seconds (using ceil()), since that this the number of whole seconds someone would have to wait to be sure the bathtub was full. But from your example cases (and the initial problem summary), it is clear that you expect seconds to be rounded down.\n\nIt would also be a good idea to clarify that there may be multiple leaks at the same height, since at least one of your test cases depends on that assumption.",
