    "content": "I like the idea (and, contrary to 5DN1L, have no moral objection to the storyline; let's be the bad guy for once). However, at first sight the statement seems long for a clash. Some suggestions to make the statement shorter:\n- turn the example in only 2 or 3 iterations;\n- remove the Note (such story parts are nice in a puzzle, but in a Clash I get annoyed when I start reading info that then was not needed to solve the Clash)\n- The three steps are per pair of digits, the pairs do not interact with each other, correct? Then you could rephrase the steps into something like:\n\" For each pair of digits (HH, MM, SS):\n1. Take the sum of the pair;\n2. Multiply the sum by an index that increases ...\n3. Take the modulo 23, 59 and 59 for the pairs HH, MM, SS, respectively.\nThe new timestamp is a combination of these three results. Repeat these steps [[n]] times.'",

The final phrase of step 3 is currently 'this forms the faked timestamp', which for a quick reader might suggest this is it - but actually you need to repeat the three steps.\nSo, maybe rephrase to 'this forms the timestamp for the next iteration.', and maybe add after the three steps: 'Repeat steps 1 to three [[n]] times, each time using the resulting timestamp as input for the next iteration.', or something like that?\n(I am just thinking out loud here - possibly I am sending you back and forth between making the statement shorter and making it clearer, apologies.)",
