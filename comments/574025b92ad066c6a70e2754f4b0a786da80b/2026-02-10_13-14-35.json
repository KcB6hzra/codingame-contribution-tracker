I have also tried to \"retrofit\" a pretty good handful of solutions from the original Sudoku Solver puzzle. Each solution could solve the first 2 test cases and validators for this 16x16 puzzle, but then timed out on everything that followed.\n\nWith this puzzle and the 25x25 puzzle, the author has done a really nice job of creating a \"family\" of Sudoku puzzles. The original Sudoku Solver is on the easy side of medium. This puzzle is on the hard side of medium. The 25x25 puzzle is definitely on the very hard side of hard.",

This puzzle is about adding some intelligence to your backtracking, rather than brain-dead brute force backtracking. You and I have obviously both implemented DLX for the 25x25. For us, it's probably natural to think about adding smarts to our backtracking whenever possible.
