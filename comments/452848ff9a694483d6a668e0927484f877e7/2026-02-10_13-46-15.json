In Hungary I learned in math class the ''half round away from zero' as the 'normal' way to do rounding, so I automatically used that. Also, in PHP - which I used for sample solution - the built in round() uses PHP_ROUND_HALF_UP by default, which is the  same at least for positive distances.\nSo it is a nice example for that in international environment we shall not assume anything as 'normal way'.",
