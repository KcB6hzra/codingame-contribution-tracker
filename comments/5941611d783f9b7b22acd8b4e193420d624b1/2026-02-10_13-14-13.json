The other link is:\nhttps://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/59415d68c6bcec29739305d7fc075f75f047e\n\nGoal section\n* Please fix the typo: \"rising\" => \"raising\".\n\n* I would suggest to change \"125%10 = 5\" to \"125 => 5\" and \"216%10\" to \"216 => 6\" to avoid giving away a hint in the operator to use in the code.\n\n* I would suggest to delete \"(holds for any single digit number)\" to avoid excessive explanation.\n\nInput section\n* Please change \"An integer\" to \"An integer [[n]]\".\n\n* Please move \" 0 <= n < 10^123435\" to Constraints section. Please also revise the upper limit because\n(a) it does not reflect the actual cases being tested,\n(b) you need to declare n as a long (or a string because even a long may not be good enough and there will be overflow...) instead of an int in the stub generator if a very very large number is really included in the test cases.\n\nCases\n* Please change the cases so that there are no duplicates with the same inputs.\n\nGame modes\n* Is it easy to guess the requirements in Reverse mode?\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "Thanks for your comment.\n\nThis was the first simple idea that came as my first contribution. I am surprised about the number of directions it can be pushed.\n\nIn the current formulation with last digit (plus length being positive), replacements are cyclic, so the task can be solved with simple character replacement. I thought I can make this observation necessary with big [[n]], but it doesn't seem to work, and probably it makes no sense in CoC. I removed the constraint.\n\nI think it is fine for Revers. I will just fiddle a bit with examples to lead the reader.",
