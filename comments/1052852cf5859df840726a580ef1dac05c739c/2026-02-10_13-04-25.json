It would be clearer because I didn't quite understand what you meant. I had a solution where the decimal corresponded to a percentage of 60 min, which of course didn't work. I realized my mistake thanks to the validators which helped me understand what you meant with this sentence.\n\nIt could be something like '0.3 means 30 minutes' because 0.3 could be 3min or 300 min, this is not obvious when you say 'converted'. \n\nPlus, it would be great to add a validator with an entry that has a decimal equal to 6 like 2.6.",

It's important that the input looks like a float so I don't want to have \"4.30\". I agree, an example with minutes could help, or an explanation in description. I will change it a bit.",

So I wrote Test 5: \"14.7\" => \"14:70\" => \"15:10\" => \"08:50\"\nI wanted to create a Reverse clash, where every Tests are directly displayed, with Test 7 being \"23.59\" => \"00:01\" I think it gives a huge hint on what to do with that input. And it invites coder to be attentive to every tests provided (no disrespect intended).\n\nNow about my question: as I wrote above, I wanted to create a Reverse puzzle, so I checked the appropriate game mode. But I don't know if doing so means this puzzle will always be a Reverse puzzle or if it means it just can be a Reverse puzzle. Maybe, to be sure it will be set as Reverse I have to uncheck \"Speed\" mode.\n\nI hope my puzzle and my question are clearer now. Thanks in advance.",
