    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: The clash is nice and the description is clear!\n\nI do however suggest you to follow the friendly hints of Timinator concerning the text of the goal section; currently some sentences are not completely correct. Or, following as much as possible your text, I would suggest the following (but, unlike Timinator, English is not my first language, so my text might be incorrect as well):\n'You have to find where the coin is hidden. We start with many glasses, under one of which we hide a coin. We move around the glass, and you have to find out under which glass the coin is hidden. We have input 0-0-0-0-x; the x means that we start with the coin under glass number 5. After that, we have some numbers +5 and -2, which means we shift the coin 5 to the right or 2 to the left. Thus, the coin will be under the third glass, and we answer in output 0-0-x-0-0.'\n\nI still approved the clash, because the description is clear enough, my own English is also not perfect, and the clash is nice.",

    "content": "Nice Clash! This is the exact kind of Clash that makes me mad. I did it pretty fast (2 or 3 minutes) and I know some other Codingamer or TWO would have done it faster than me.\n\nI have the utmost respect for people that speak multiple languages. I (unfortunately for me) only speak one. If I may, I'd like to suggest the following edits to your goal section:\n\nYou must locate a hidden <<coin>>, represented by an {{x}}. To start, a set of <<glasses>>, represented by zeros {{0}}, is lined up and a coin is hidden under one of them. The glasses are moved around, and you must identify under which glass the coin is located at the end.\n\nFor example, given input of <<0-0-0-0-x>>, the {{x}} means the coin starts under glass number 5. After that, input of <<+5>> and <<-2>> mean the glass with the coin under it is shifted by 5 to the right and then by 2 to the left wrapping around to the beginning or end as necessary. Thus, the coin will be under the third glass at the end, and the answer to output is <<0-0-x-0-0>>.",

That's what the Example section is for. Besides, I have no idea why \"*\" is part of line 1 - shouldn't it be \"x\"?\n\nThanks.",
