Apparently, there were some hidden edge cases: failing on either test or validator number 5 (or both) depending on rounding (up, down or both). Changes made:\n- In the statement, it is added that rounding should not happen at all;\n- Test/validator 5 are changed to make them similar (they fail now both if there is rounding or rounding up)\n- Test/validator 6 is added (they fail both if there is rounding or rounding down)",

    "content": "Wow, thanks as usual! I believe I've implemented your comments.\n\nAs per your issue regarding the example: I have been puzzling a bit on how to introduce the break time. I settled for the following: any break started while there are still visitors in line, is counted as break - even if during that break the line is resolved by other counters. If however the break would start at a moment that there are no visitors in line anymore, that break is not counted (the work is simply finished).\n\nFor the swapped case:\nFirst visitor is helped in 20 minutes at first counter, second visitor is helped in 30 minutes at second counter. After 20 minutes, at the first counter the break starts, finishing at 20+10 = 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, we have the following situation: first counter has had 1 visitor, one break, and second counter has just finished 1 visitor. Automatically, the third visitor will go for the first counter -- the second counter is just about to start it's break, but there is no need for the break any more, because the line of visitors is already resolved. So, no break for the second counter.\n--> Output: 2 1 visitors, 1 0 breaks.",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply.\n\nMy thought is that, at the end of 30 minutes, one counter has just finished a break, and another counter has just finished helping a visitor. If we ignore the order of the counter, it is natural that the counter which is coming back from break serves the remaining visitor, and the other counter can just go home without taking a break (as there are no more visitors anyway).\n\nI understand your logic, but it just feels odd to me that different orders result in different conclusions. It's like splitting the decision-making process at Minute 30 into Minute 30.1: let counter 1 take a break, Minute 30.2: counter 2 help the remaining customer.\n\nI have a suggestion to avoid such a situation: actions should be assigned based on the type of actions first, and the order (index) of counters next.\n\nBy \"type of actions\" I mean, at any particular minute, if there are multiple available counters:\n(a) Some counters are not entitled to breaks yet - assign customers to them.\n(b) Some counters are entitled to breaks, but they will take a break only if there are still customers to be helped.\n(c) If there are no more customers, ALL remaining counters (whether they are entitled to breaks or they are NOT YET entitled to breaks) can leave without taking a break.\n\nIt's just a suggestion. And it's absolutely ok to keep the rules the way you want it :)",

For the nature of the story, it would indeed make sense that, because at minute 30 the last customer can be helped by the second counter, the first counter does not need its break any more. It took me however a bit of puzzling to include that in my code (it is in there now, but not yet in the best way, I think). I do like that it is in there now, because it is always nice if a story is logically correct and that this correctness leads to a twist for the coding solution.\n\nSo, I fully agree with you. I have not (yet) included the 'order of actions' as text in the statement, but I did add the specification that a counter will never start on a break at the same time helping of the last customer starts, and I have changed the example text. I've added the example itself as fifth test as well.",

In the meanwhile I would suggest you to move the newest cases as the first pair - the simplest ones should go first, especially when there is association explanation in the statement.\n\nYou may also want to think whether additional test cases would be needed to cover the case of \"counters not yet entitled to breaks but there are no more customers waiting\" (I mean, like there are three categories of counters as per my last comment), if no such cases are there yet.\n\nJust let me know when you're done, and I'll take another look :wink:",
