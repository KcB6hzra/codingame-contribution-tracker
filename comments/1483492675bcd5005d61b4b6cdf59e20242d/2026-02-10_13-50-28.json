    "content": "It seems like a really fun puzzle.\n\nBut the test cases are simpler than what could be theoretically expected. They can all be solved by the simplest inference, adding one more completely certain bumbbell at each step, never having to consider multiple variants and backtracking.\n\nThis isn't necessarily bad but since it's not obvious from the statement I think it's a bit unfair. Sure, you can figure out that this is the case by implementing it and submitting, but for some OCD types like myself that want to solve stuff with a single submit it just doesn't feel quite right.\n\nThen again I'm not sure how I'd fix this... adding more complicated test-cases may overcomplicate the puzzle too much. Maybe it's ok to assume OCD types like myself are rare enough to ignore.",

The only things that seems strictly lacking are:\n  * some kind of note that input is only formed of '.' and 'o' (no '-' or '|')\n  * the fact that the solution is only made up of complete dumbbells, no standalone pieces allowed\n\nBut then again, I managed to infer.",
