However, This one is exactly the same your other puzzle \"Tile a Floor\", except for the mirrored characters. I have only one line of code to change to have a solution for this.\nMaybe i'm wrong, but i think two different puzzles should differ more than that. It's my opinion and if any doesn't agree please explain to me if there is any rule on that.\nIf i am wrong and doing two very similar puzzles is allowed, well, i'll approve it.",

Maybe it's ok. I don't know.\n\nIt may be a good idea to add \"(Part 1)\" to the title of the other puzzle. Or maybe instead of \"(Part 1)\" and \"(Part 2)\", distinguish the puzzles by the symmetry types instead.\n\nConstraints section\n* Please delete the word \"Constraints\".\n\n* Please change N to \"[[quarterSize]]\".\n\nThanks.",
