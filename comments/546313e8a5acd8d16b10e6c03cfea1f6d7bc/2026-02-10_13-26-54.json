At least according to this https://www.piday.org/million/ :\nUp to 16 decimals the value of pi is 3.1415926535897932, and the test expects 3.141592653589797, but using the formula in the statement gives 3.141592653589794, which is closer.\n\n\nEdit2:\nThis comes from the precision of double.

It was very fun, and requires only a single while loop that self decrements. Also understanding how to produce 15 digit floats.\n\nGoing through, the only problem I see, is that at 15 decimals, You can't go past 26 and get a different answer. So you could hard code \"if n > 25\" and always get the right answer \n\nI didn't thoroughly test, it may be >26 or >25\n\nAlso since there's only 26 possible answers, it would be VERY easy to hard code this for massive optimization.",
