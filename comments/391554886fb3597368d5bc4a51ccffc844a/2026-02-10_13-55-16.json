I'll try and rework it so that the problem is not easily solved with a simple text replacement. Personally I find that the puzzles in the community section are getting a little too hard and we need to have a few more medium difficulty puzzles for those that are not at the 'top of the food chain' so to speak. Also, this was my first submission so I just wanted to test the waters.",

Good job!\n\nSeems upvote-worthy to me at least now.\n\nMinor stuff:\n\n* is there a way to either use a fixed-width font or at least constant-width characters (like, usually, digits and +-) for the given carpets? The level 3 one gets real ugly.\n\n* I think it's usually spelled \"Aladdin\"\n\n* scientific notation in the constraints \"9.0E18\" makes it sound like we can expect a fractional number here. I'd personally go with \"9 * 10^18\" to keep it integral.\n\nEdit:\n\n* oh, and you can merge the X1 and X2 constraint lines.",
