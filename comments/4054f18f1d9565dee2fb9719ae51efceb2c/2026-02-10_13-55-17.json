    "content": "Very interesting! \nStill I find the statement quite confusing when it comes to cells and buildings.  \nFor example,  \"cell is a building\",  and then \"buildings are circular and very small width-wise\".\nAlso, \"the center cell\" makes sense only when n is odd, which is worth an explicit mention (for even n, it's a slightly different problem).\n\nIf I understand your intentions correctly, it's better to say\n- The city is composed of n*n square cells;\n- In the middle of each cells there is a very very thin circular building, except for the central parcel (n will be always odd).\n\nUpvoted the idea (but think some clarification is needed before approval).",

    "content": "I guess we agree but I couldn't spot the changes I had in mind (I suppose I should've been more clear myself). So let's make it straight:\n\n* You can't say \"cell is a building\", it induces a wrong or confusing image: if I understand correctly, your buildings are points in the middle of square cells and it should be made explicit.\n\n* You've added a note that n is odd in the Constraints ( :) ), but I think it should be  placed somewhere *near* the first mention of \"the center cell\" (it  makes no sense without it, so the reader may be puzzled). \n\nSo for the first paragraph, please consider the wording I suggested above (it's free from those ambiguities).\n\nBTW you could and should  avoid  \"perfect square\" as well (just \"square\" is clear enough). \"Perfect square\" has a popular algebraic meaning that makes a distraction from the present geometric setting.",
