It was interesting, more complex than I expected, but still very simple in practice.\nI really enjoyed coding this one.\nI think it could be interesting for beginners to learn the basics, and for more experienced programmers to just have fun.\n\n\nMy solution (completed in ~2minutes) :\nn = list(input())\ns=\"\"\nind=len(n)\nfor i in range(len(n)):\n    if n[i]!=\"0\":\n        s+=n[i]+\"x1\"+((ind-int(i)-1)*\"0\")+\"+\"\nprint(s[:-1])",

    "content": "Expanded Notation is an usefull concept from elementary math education. As such this challenge has real world relevance.\n\nThe task is basically straightforward, but  requires some work with loops or similar. String formating is always an interesting basic exercise.\n\nIt adds an interesting twist because you have to consider zero digits.\n\nOne thing I would advise is having a testcase with a really large number. Maybe some edgecases like palindrome numbers and single digits.\n\nAn intertesting exercise, with a slightly higer difficulty would be the reverse conversion.",
