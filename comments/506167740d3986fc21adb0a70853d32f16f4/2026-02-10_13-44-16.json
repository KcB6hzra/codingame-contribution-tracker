    "content": "I managed to get 100% in 13:36.\nNot only are there very large test cases, but there are a lot of them. When I finally got the right code, it still took a long time just to wait for it to check them all.\nSomething very strange happened in C++:\nlong long res = pow(100000007,2)\nwas giving me\n10000001400000050 !!?!\nI figured something with floating point rounding, but what a PITA.\nI ended up using a loop to raise the root to the nth power, instead of pow().\nThen it worked. So, for some reason, the Clash was only very difficult because of a C++ language problem. (Yes, I cast everything to long long before calculating; it really was using 100000007 as the input)\nLike I said, checking takes a super long time even when your code is perfect; the high numbers are naturally justified to make people think, but I think you could leave out 4 of the 12 test cases, e.g., and it would not change much.",

You always have to first google and copy the Eratosthenes stuff or another algo that does the trick. Your contribution adds a twist to it, and therefore could be a good enough challenge but it doesn't look like much fun to me. You basically ask if the number is a power of a prime. Maybe that is why it has been rather downvoted so far. It is Coding, but it should be Game as well. I do not downvote, though, because what I just wrote is purely subjective and other players might see fun where I don't.",

    "content": "I modified it to be easier just now so perhaps you should rethink your approval!!!\n\nActually, it was kind of unreasonable to expect anyone to code it in 5 minutes but maybe it's not obvious why. Since the constraints are 10^18, you need to realize that normal prime factoring algorithms won't work and come up with a problem-specific solution (checking the square root up front, then only going to the cube root of 10^18). \n\nEven when you do that there was a big trap in the big square 4 factors test. (Before you had to check if a number was a PRIME power.) So you have to write another function to check if a number is prime. At minimum this is two decent sized functions + some cleverness, my experience with CoC is either 1 decent sized function and some cleverness, or just one of the last two.\n\nAlternatively one can binary search for the pth powers + check low powers, this is also a decent amount of work, unless I'm missing something, I don't think this was easy at all.\n\nThe modification I made gets rid of the big trap so it should be better. Maybe I should add a warning about time complexity?",

    "content": "I changed the statement a bit: now you don't have to check if a number is a prime power, just a perfect power. This gets rid of the need for a prime check and simplifies the problem somewhat, making it easier to guess in reverse mode and easier to code in general. This changes the flavor text quite a bit, but the only test case that changes in my set is test 5. Therefore, there is less emphasis on trying to find a prime. Actually, the idea of this challenge is to create a situation where 'the Eratosthenes sieve or another algo' does not work and stop people who just jump to said idea (I will write more on this in response to python_programmerPP). IMO this problem requires a lot more thought than most, what do you think about the changes?",
