    "content": "The words 'valid' and 'invalid' are poorly chosen and confusing.\nIn fast mode you read the statement diagonally, so for example I just read 'Valid or Invalid' in first line, jump to the condition in second line and expected it to be the valid condition (and it makes more sens that way).\nThen I checked the example and it didn't make sense, I went back to the statement and there was no explained example, and had to scroll trhough everything to find it in the Output section and finally understood.\nIt took me more than 2min to understand then 15 sec to code while with a better overall presentation it would have taken a total of 30 sec.",
