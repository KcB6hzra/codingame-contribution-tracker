    "content": "Unicode was intentionally avoided because I don't know enough about all the languates offered by CodinGame to anticipate if it would be an easily avoidable hurdle for certain users. The description does state that's it's given in ASCII and lists the sequence at the end of the line (visibility may be poor given the color scheme used for that highlighting).\n\nNumPy was used because it was the simplest tool I could find in the language; it could probably also be compared to using explosives on an anthill. It's used for finding the RREF of the matrix which as far as I know is the quickest way to get a computer to solve a system of equations. For a pure python version see http://pastebin.com/GSgXkhr4 (diff https://www.diffchecker.com/nvKDPAsr ) which uses code from https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Reduced_row_echelon_form which also shows implementations for several languages, many of which don't require any libraries.\n\nI believe this problem could be solved without any such mathmatical systems, and my first attempt at a solution was simply imcrement and check. Unfortunately attempting to naively brute-force the problem can result in loops which makes a math-based approach easier. When I had to do these sort of things manually in school I would never attempt such a system, especially by hand, but computers don't posses the same level of intuition a human does.\n\nI think this problem may be harder than average, however I don't think that should be a seen as a detriment.",

I merely cleared any potential confusion.\n\nFor linalg, please note I'm not berating you for using it in your solution, it does make total sense. I'm simply bemoaning the fact only one language currently has deployed support for it, which makes such class of problem unfairly (by whatever measure) biased towards Python.\n\nFWIW, my reference implementation bruteforced, because it does pass, and I'm a bit fed up with reimplementing gaussian reduction over and over again.",
