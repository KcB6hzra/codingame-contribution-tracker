    "content": "Can I make a suggestion that would simplify this a bit? You could have the maps completely surrounded by water on the edges, to eliminate the need for bounds checking during the recursive search. You could furthermore guarantee, without changing the adjacency rules, that every island is completely surrounded by water even on the diagonals, so that the problem could actually be solved using either adjacency condition, 4 or 8. The latter is easier to iterate over.",
