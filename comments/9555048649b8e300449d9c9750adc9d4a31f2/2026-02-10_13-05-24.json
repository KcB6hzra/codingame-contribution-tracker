I don't think you should try to encode a decision of whether a word is a proper noun or not into a clash, especially not a Reverse one.\n\nWhat would happen if the sentence started with \"Alice\", how would you know whether it's capitalised due to being the first word or due to being a proper noun? I think you should just treat all capitalised words the same, as Stef_3 said. So the \"Complex case\" tests need to be adjusted.",

So, \"Hello world\" -> \"Hello-hello world-world\" and \"Hello Mr Cat\" -> \"Hello-hello Mr-mr Cat-cat\"\n- Guarantee that punctuation can only be at the end of a word, not at the beginning, so \"Hello, world!\" is allowed but \"In _that_ direction\" is not allowed.\n- Output the doubled words space-separated, not newline-separated; it was much prettier and satisfying this way. Now with the newlines it doesn't look like sentences.\n\nThis way, there are exactly two things to take care of: capitals at the beginning of the word, and punctuation at the end of the word.",
