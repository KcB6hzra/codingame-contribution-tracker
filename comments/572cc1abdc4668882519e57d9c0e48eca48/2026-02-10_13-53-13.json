    "content": "Cool puzzle. As someone who has played a bit of osu! this was pretty straight forward and fun, but I can understand for others it would be overwhelming and arbitrarily complex.\nWhile attempting this puzzle out, I had the combo initialized to 1, \"By default, the Combo Multiplier is equal to 1.\", but I couldn't get the correct score until I changed it to be initialized to 0.\nPeople keep talking about op's solution, I'm new to community puzzles, how do I go about seeing op's solution? I would like to see what I was doing wrong with the combo multiplier.\nAll we need now is a puzzle for calculating PP ;)",
