I feel like the last line of your rules, it should be clear that it needs to meet both criteria to be a cheater. Just tiny logic thing I got stuck on. \n\nAdditionally, with the comment rules, I feel like it should be lines including the specified symbols, not beginning with. There are a couple cases (Aronse, neo.hrtns) where there are actual comments at the end of lines. This should work since there is no python floor division anywhere in the cases, but I do see this would conflict with EvilRubyist's case, due to the ruby code. \n\nIf you do like that suggestion, perhaps you could alter the rule to be ignore more than one # in a single line? I'm not sure it would matter either way with that case since it does already meet both criteria. \n\nI also thought the Slow.Coder99 case was funny! Wonder if there is anything that could be implemented to detect that kind of case.",

    "content": "That works too.\n\nThe reason for my original suggestion was to avoid sounding too absolute by labelling someone a \"cheater\" as if it were a proven fact. Instead, focusing on a score (i.e. the probability of cheating, never 100%) keeps the judgement more cautious. There's always a chance of false positives or false negatives.\n\nJust a thought: a determined cheater could simply add \"don't write any comments in the code\" when prompting an AI to generate the solution 🙃\n\nAnyway…\n\nGoal\n* Consider adding a blank line between the criteria and the notes for improved readability.\n\n* Note 3: You might want to change \"spaces\" to \"leading spaces\", especially in light of the next point…\n\nCases\n* Please add cases where the code contains comments that start with \"# include\" (both with and without leading spaces) and the clasher is labelled a cheater.\n\n* Please add cases where the code contains a comment that starts with leading spaces followed by \"/*\" and the clasher is labelled a cheater.\n\n* Please add cases where solution_time is greater than 99 seconds (i.e. a 3-digit value) and the number of comments is ≥ 5.\n\n* Number of comments in the current cheater cases:\n  • Pair 2: 5 (test), 6 (validator)\n  • Pair 3: 5 (test), 6 (validator)\n  • Pair 4: 6 (test), 6 (validator)\n  • Pair 7: 9 (test), 5 (validator)\n  \n  Consider swapping Test 2 and Validator 2 for a bit of variation.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "Thanks. Implemented everything now, except for the \"   /*\" suggestion I just edited pair 7 instead of creating a new pair.\n\nThis is definitely not a great cheater-detection algo, in terms of false negatives, but I've found a lot of cheaters don't bother asking it to leave out comments. The ones that do, I have no way to be sure are cheaters unless they submit faster than it's possible to type the solution, and their variable names are long and descriptive. I thought about complicating the clash in such ways, but decided counting comments was already a big enough challenge for a clash. I don't think false positives are a worry for the examples I've used, they all submitted code way too fast, with descriptive comments and long variable names - to me that's a guaranteed signal for AI-generated code.",
