    "content": "You state in the statement that Gregory was born on Feb 29. This means he is born in a leap year - in other words, in my code I can loop over a range starting from his birth year, check for leaps, and distract with one (because I should exclude the birth year).\nSadly, however, this does not work, because in your input the year of birth is not always a leap year. Eg 1974 and 1975 are not leap years.\n\nPlease change your statement or change the input of those cases, because at this moment it is incorrect.",

Also in 'Easy' there are four leap years, not three. See for example here https://miniwebtool.com/leap-years-list/?start_year=2000&end_year=2012\n\nHowever, there are no problems in my head with the other testcases :)",
