(Neither do distinct prime counts.) I'll admit the problem wording is evasive, but in my interpretation of the problem, that's at odds with the fact the transformation maps a prime to a prime. Or with the way the transformation extends from primes to composites (the specification's an example, I thought I got it but how to be sure?) Or something else that eluded me.\n\nOh, and I hate you (in a respectful way): the clues are nonobvious enough I'm going to have to switch languages to keep it reasonable. Which is good for a community puzzle, but I wouldn't have wanted that to happen to me in clash context.\nThe Pi constraint ought to have been a hint, but it's too late for me to have caught it.
