My solution is not able to handle case where the bottom of the grid cuts the ridges of the mountains. Therefore I added this text in the constaint:\n - There is no {{/}} or {{\\}} in the bottom line. In other words, the crest of the mountains in the foreground runs from one end of the grid to the other.\n\nIf you have a solution that solves the the cases where multiple '/' or '\\' appear in the bottom line, I'll be happy to see it.\n\nYour second test case gave me an idea for a newly added test entitled \"Nested mountains\".\n\nThe newly added test \"Aligned mountains\" is directly inspired from your third test case.\n\nI do not understand the last test case. There seems to be lots of ridges hidden behind the mountain in the foreground; but I do not see any special 4x3 pattern that explictly give the location where the foreground mountain hides those ridges.",

I added a test named \"Close summits\" for this case. I also had to update my solution ;-)\n\nFor test No hidden pass (Test/Validator 6), I confirm the output is 3 and not 5. This test has two ridges. The front ridge has two mountains; let call them MountainLeft and MountainRight. The back ridge has one mountain; let call it MountainCenter. The summit of MountainCenter is located between the summit of MountainLeft and the summit of MountainRight. What you see left of MountainLeft, is the left foot of MountainCenter. What you see right of MountainRight is the right foot of MountainCenter.",

I think the remaining tests are straightforward to interpret.

    "content": "Apologies, did not realise there was a thread going on here. I think that an exhaustive list of partially hidden ridges would be quite infeasible due to two main reasons:\n\n1. There are a lot of cases to consider. Given 3 distinct patterns where the left side of a ridge is partially hidden, 3 distinct patterns where the right side of a ridge is partially hidden, and 3 different \"height\" permutations of disjoint ridges (left side is \"higher\", right side is \"higher\", or both sides are of the same \"height\"), there are (at least) 27 cases to enumerate and define, which might make the puzzle description too long.\n\n2. Interaction between partially-hidden disjoint ridges is (thus far) very vision-based (i.e., it \"looks\" as if two disjoint ridges should join together). This becomes problematic to define when more than two disjoint ridges are involved; e.g.:\n\n8 16\n          ------\n         /      \n        /       \n      -----     \n     /     \\    \n----/       \\---\n   /         \\  \n---           --\n\n11 25\n            /\\           \n           /  \\----------\n          /    \\         \n         /      \\        \n--------/        \\-------\n       /          \\      \n      /            \\     \n     /              \\----\n    /                \\   \n   /                  \\  \n---                    --",

Your observation may also imply the necessity of additional constraints to rule out certain scenarios.\n\nIt appears that @Kk81's solution is largely generic and geometry-driven. The only effectively hardcoded part is the identification of hidden ridges via specific visual patterns. This suggests that the cleanest way to rewrite the statement would be to remove the \"minimum number of summits\" rule and the examples of hidden-ridge pairs, and instead describe the ridge-based model used by the solution: how ridges are formed, how hidden segments are detected and merged, and how summits are defined from those ridges.\n\nWriting the statement in a principle-driven manner would keep it concise, align it closely with the actual solution logic, and allow additional challenging cases to be added without extending the statement with more examples.",

    "content": "I've performed a deeper review of the puzzle.\n\nThe puzzle statement appears to encourage the following high-level approach:\n\n1. Identify the ridges.\n2. For each ridge, complete its hidden sections.\n3. Identify and count summits on each completed ridge.\n4. Sum the total number of summits.\n\nThis expectation is strongly suggested by the example, which explicitly reconstructs three complete ridges (front, middle, and back), including characters that do not appear in the original input. The example then relies on those completed ridges to justify the final summit count. The detailed rules describing how hidden sections may be completed further reinforce the idea that ridge reconstruction is required to finish the task.\n\nWhile the statement makes this overall goal clear, some of the reconstruction mechanics that the example implicitly relies on are not stated explicitly. Without those being made clear, different readers may reasonably interpret the reconstruction process differently, potentially leading to different answers.\n\n*** Identifying ridges ***\n\nThe example shows that visible portions of the input must be associated into distinct ridges before summits can be counted.\n\nThe definition of a ridge is clear, but other than that, the statement does not give further guidance on:\n\n(a) how the input should be disaggregated into ridge sections, and\n\n(b) when two ridge sections should be treated as belonging to the same ridge.\n\n*** Completing hidden sections ***\n\nThe statement specifies which characters are allowed when completing hidden sections of a ridge in different situations, which is the most critical rule. However, because ridge reconstruction is necessary in order to apply the summit definition, additional rules appear necessary to avoid unintended interpretations.\n\nIn particular, the example suggests that, after a ridge is completed:\n\n* Each ridge occupies exactly one non-space character per column.\n\n* Characters along a ridge form a continuous path across adjacent columns. That means non-space characters in adjacent columns must be in adjacent rows, except when both are {{-}}, in which case both must be in the same row.\n\n* Non-space characters used to fill the hidden sections must lie below the initially visible mountain outline (they cannot be above it because they wouldn't be hidden in the first place).\n\nI suggest to state such rules explicitly, as without them there may be multiple valid ways to complete hidden sections that differ structurally rather than merely cosmetically.\n\nIt also appears that while there may be multiple valid ways to fill hidden sections under the stated rules, the number of summits remains invariant across all valid completions. Making this invariant explicit would help readers understand that reconstruction serves only to enable summit identification, rather than to determine a unique completed shape.",

    "content": "*** Role of 4x3 patterns ***\n\nThe six 4x3 intersection patterns are clearly listed and illustrated, and their purpose is to indicate where one ridge hides another and to constrain how hidden sections may be completed. The statement requires readers to recognise and reason about these patterns explicitly.\n\nHowever, when exploring how hidden ridges can be completed, it appears that the relative positions of the visible endpoints of ridge segments play a more direct role in determining valid completions than the specific 4x3 patterns themselves.\n\nIt may therefore be possible to simplify the presentation by expressing the completion rules in terms of the relative positions of the visible endpoints of a ridge segment (including edge-of-grid cases), without explicitly referring to the 4×3 patterns. Such a reformulation could preserve the puzzle’s intended complexity while reducing cognitive overhead for readers.\n\nBelow is a simplified approach for your consideration:\n\nLet A be the rightmost character in the visible section to the left of a gap, and B be the leftmost character of the section to the right of the gap.\n\n* If B is lower than A, fill the gap using {{-}} and {{\\}}.\n\n* If B is higher than A, fill the gap using {{-}} and {{/}}.\n\n* If B is at the same height as A (i.e. in the same row), fill the gap using {{-}} only (since both A and B must be {{-}}; all other cases are invalid).\n\nEdge-of-grid cases:\n\n(It isn't necessary to extend the ridge beyond the grid boundaries, but doing so can make it easier to visualise whether a summit is partially cut off at the edges.)\n\n* To extend beyond the left edge of the grid, use {{/}}.\n\n* To extend beyond the right edge of the grid, use {{\\\\}}.\n\nFor reference, I've also drawn a table listing all possible scenarios under these simplified rules: https://pastebin.com/JaQ8Jw4Q\n\nI have a few other observations as well, but it may be best to review the points above first.\n\nThanks.",

We're getting much closer to the final version.\n\nGoal\n* I understand your rationale for leaving the identification and grouping of ridges out of the statement. The main risk I see is in cases such as \"Partially hidden summit\" (Test/Validator 7), where nothing in the statement explicitly suggests that two incomplete ridge segments should be grouped as part of the same ridge.\n\nTo reduce this ambiguity, I suggest adding a high-level sentence such as:\n\nNon-space characters that can be connected into a continuous path across columns while satisfying the completion rules belong to the same ridge.\n\nI believe this captures the intended behaviour, though please correct me if I'm misunderstanding the model.\n\nTo make room for the above sentence, a few small cuts could be considered:\n\n  • The last two lines of the middle ridge illustration may be redundant with the updated example.\n\n  • The phrase \"with 5 summits\" in the section on intersections could be removed.\n  \n  • The word \"several\" could be removed from the rules in the final section without loss of meaning.\n\nGoal - minor editorial notes\n* I'm not sure what \"28 / going upwards and\" refers to; could this be removed?\n\n* Please add a period after \"in the first place)\".\n\nConstraints\n* What's the significance of the third constraint? Can it be removed?\n\nCases\n* From a puzzle-solving perspective, some later test cases appear to introduce concepts earlier than expected, which can make incremental development harder. For example, when I ignore partially hidden summits (those hidden by other mountains rather than cut off at the grid edges), all cases pass except for:\n\n  • Partially hidden summit (Test/Validator 7)\n  • Two in front of three (Test/Validator 9)\n  • Four in front of one flat summit (Test/Validator 12)\n  • One in front of three (Test/Validator 14)\n  • 8 pointed summits + 1 flat (Test/Validator 15)\n\nThis suggests that it might be better for these cases to be moved to the end. Some of the remaining cases may also benefit from reordering by increasing complexity.\n\nMore generally, introducing rules gradually and increasing difficulty across the cases (ideally in an order that mirrors the statement) could improve the solving experience. That said, I'll trust your judgment on how best to reorder them.\n\n* Given how much the statement has evolved since version 1, I'm also wondering about overall case coverage. I'll review this further, but I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts as well.\n\nThanks.",

In other words, the ridge of the mountains in the foreground runs from one end of the grid to the other.\nBut you told me to remove the final sentence 5 days ago.\n\nI reordered the test by increasing difficulty:\n  - one ridge\n  - several ridges without intersection\n  - partially hidden ridges to be completed only on the edges\n  - partially hidden ridges to be completed between visible characters\n\nI think we are good for test coverage. Each time I imagine a new test, it violates one of the completion rule for partially hidden ridge such as:\n7 44\n             /\\                /\\           \n        ----/  \\              /  \\----      \n       /   /    \\            /    \\   \\     \n      /   /      \\          /      \\   \\    \n     /   /        \\        /        \\   \\   \n    /   /          \\      /          \\   \\  \n--------            ------            ------",

It constrains outcomes, but it doesn't explain how a reader should decide that two fragments belong to one ridge rather than to different ones.\n\n* Moreover, the rule doesn't appear to hold in general. For example, in \"Intersectings ridges\" (Test 7), the bottom row of consecutive - characters is shared by multiple completed back ridges. That directly contradicts the added rule.\n\n* Please correct me if I'm misunderstanding the intended interpretation. Otherwise, I'd suggest removing this rule and using the previously suggested wording, which focuses on connectibility and continuity as the grouping principle.\n\nGoal\n* These items still need your attention:\n\n  • The last two lines of the middle-ridge illustration may be redundant with the updated example. Also, I'm not sure what \"8 / going downwards\" refers to; could this be removed?\n\n  • Similarly, I'm not sure what \"28 / going upwards\" refers to; could this be removed?\n\nCases\n* Test/Validator 7: Please change \"Intersectings\" to \"Intersecting\".\n\n* Case coverage: Please also refer to the additional cases provided by @User123 in the other discussion thread earlier today.\n\nQuestion regarding the third constraint\n* Thank you for reminding me.

    "content": "Thank you @Kk81 and @5DN1L for tackling the puzzle input. Some comments from me:\n\n[Definitions]\n\n- A ridge need not only be made up of W characters if we take into account the hidden left and right edges (which is sometimes necessary to form a summit). Moreover, the characters of the ridge must be placed such that they form a visual connection between the left and right edges of the grid. Consider the second point of the partial ridge completion section: \"Characters along a completed ridge form a continuous path across adjacent columns.\"\n\n- Every ridge must contain at least one summit (which is why \"A flat ridge (- repeated W times) counts as one summit.\"). A summit must be part of a ridge. It might make sense to define summits after defining ridges.\n\n- For the definition of an intersection, perhaps it might be better to use the term \"ridge\" instead of \"mountain\", to keep consistent with the previous terms:\n\"An <<intersection>> is the location where two ridges intersect, such that one of the ridges is \"hidden\" from view by the other ridge.\"\n\n- Under partial ridge completion rules, it might help to add a rule for the case where multiple partial ridges require completion:\n\"When multiple partial ridges are visible and available to be used for ridge completion, you must select the ridge(s) that result in the fewest number of summits. Note that this rule alone is not sufficient to ensure a unique solution - there may be more than one way to complete the ridges, all resulting in the same number of summits.\"\n\n[Constraints]\n\n- Is the constraint that characters that make up an intersection will never be reused to make up another intersection still in play?\n\n- Please state that the mountain ranges are physically valid; in particular, that there will never be a case where a ridge obstructs (hides) another ridge at one section and yet becomes hidden by the same ridge in another section.",
