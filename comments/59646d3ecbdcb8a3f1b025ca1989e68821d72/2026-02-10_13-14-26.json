Overall I thought this was a fun problem that was too easy to be a puzzle and a really good fit for a clash",

I spent about a minute finding a formula, and then a minute or two implementing that formula. Basically, this clash is balanced as in if one can derive the formula they can implement and win, but if one couldn't derive it then they can still get at least some but not all of the test cases.\n\nOverall, this clash looks good to me.",

    "content": "This is a very interesting problem, but its too hard for a clash. I was working on it for 30ish minutes and never figured it out. This is mainly because I am dumb and don't know math but chances are most other people don't know the formula either.\n\nOne suggestion I have is to just make the clash brute force-able. That way, even if people don't know the simple way of doing it they can still get the answer.",
