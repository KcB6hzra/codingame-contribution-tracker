    "content": "This is a nice clash, but everyone in my clash got 85% or less, including me.\n\nValidator 2 was the problem for me. It is the only test/validator that tests for the issue where the index of the code the user input doesn't match their unit number, because an earlier unit uses the same code. It's a silly bug, but it would be good to cover it in a test case, so that it doesn't take clashers by surprise. I got 100% on tests so thought I was fine, but didn't think about this issue.",

Instead, the Constraints section will state:\n[[S]] is always in the format of flat number + \"*\" + door code.\n* Delete \"Valid\" as in \"Valid door codes\" because it is kind of invalid if the code is actually not matching.\n\nOutput section\n* I would suggest to move all the explanation to the Goal section, so that this section will state:\n<<Line 1:>> A string {{Open}}, {{Wrong Code}} or {{Wrong Flat}}\n\nWording\n* For the sake of consistency, especially given that one of the possible answer is \"Wrong Flat\", suggest these wordings to replace the original ones:\nGoal: \"newly built building\", \"flat number\"\nInput: \"flat number\"\nOutput: \"flat number\"\ninstead of a mix of \"building\"/\"apartment\"/\"flat(s)\".\n\nTest cases\n* I would suggest more variation of length of door codes in the inputs, if possible.\n* The last pair of test/validator is inconsistent with the constraint that N should be at least 1.\n\nStub generator\n* Please add a write statement.\n\nThanks.",

That was because I saw that originally the lengths were either 4 or 5 and there was not much variety.\nI did not mean to include codes of different lengths in a SINGLE case, because I think it is rare for the codes to be of different lengths for the same building.\n\nThanks.",
