    "content": "Cool idea, but quite hard under time pressure of a clash in its current form.\n\nI just got it in Shortest mode and won with 60%, no one else got above 0%. It was a lot harder than it looked. I was close at the end, but had some bugs still.\n\nIt would be good to note in the constraints that the missing piece will never be a corner, because that allows for some much simpler solutions to be coded just looking at rows and columns for \"#.#\" to occur.\n\nIn the clash I could see the tests had no corners, but wasn't sure if the validators would so wasted time deciding which way I was going to code it.\n\nIf you make it clear that the missing piece will always look like \"#.#\" either horizontally or vertically, then it becomes a lot more clash-friendly. It's giving away the trick in some sense, but currently I think it's just a bit too daunting without clarification of the limits of the missing piece.",

    "content": "Ah that's definitely more tricky. I played with the idea of non-rectangular, but not yet with this one (redundant fence). Let me think about it for a moment / see whether I can come up with a 5min solution. At the moment I suspect it might make it beyond clash size.\n\nEDIT: thought about it, and while I like the idea I do not dare put it in this clash. Such a test case obviously would come as one of the later cases, so I think quite some players will spend the first couple of minutes on writing a solution assuming there is only a rectangle fence (my solution for example lazily checks simply the outer-most #'s, and assumes the fence must be there). The case you propose would require a quite different approach; in my situation I would have written a full solution with some debugging in the first 5 min, then suddenly run into this case and have to write a totally different solution.",
