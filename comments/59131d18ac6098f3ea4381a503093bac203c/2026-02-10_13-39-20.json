That thought was several hours ago.\nGetting a \"green result\" in the first few test cases happened quickly; for me it was well under an hour.  However, there are a few headaches to finishing the harder test cases.\nThis puzzle is simple yet requires the coder to apply some consideration to the solution or it will time out on harder test cases.  Very nice!",
