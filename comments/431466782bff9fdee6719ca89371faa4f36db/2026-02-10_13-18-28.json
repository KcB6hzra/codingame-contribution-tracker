    "content": "I like your puzzle and I don't think it is too easy for a puzzle.  I think there are some good opportunities to compare various approaches to gathering and storing the x and y values of the enemy aircraft and the surface to air missile.  This would be a great puzzle for the young people in my life that are fairly new to the coding journey.\n\nSome minor suggestions:\n\nTitle: Shoot Enemy Aircraft instead of Shoot enemy aircrafts\n(Title case for titles doesn't seem to be 100% standardized on CG, but I like title case for titles, like you did with Hexagonal Maze.)\n\nGoal:\n\nline 1 - aircraft instead of aircrafts\nline 4 - missiles instead of missile\nline 5 - as the launcher instead of than the launcher, also... it moves instead of it move\nline 5 to 8 - some suggestions provided below\n\nThe content of the goal is clear and well done.  Consider removing some of the newlines where the sentences flow nicely together.  For instance:\n\nThere are enemy aircraft (> or <) in the sky (made of .). Each turn, they move one cell forward. You are in charge of shooting them with a surface to air missile (^). You can only shoot vertically. Each turn, your missiles move one cell up.\n\nNote: When you shoot, the missile appears at the same altitude as the launcher. Each turn, the missile moves one cell up.\n\nYou have to print, each turn, if you WAIT or if you SHOOT. You have to shoot all the enemy aircraft, and your stock is just enough, so don't SHOOT if you can't hit an aircraft. After shooting every missile, do not print the last WAITs.",
