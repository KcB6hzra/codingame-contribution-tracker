I didn't face any problem while implementing the memory part to the solver, but that scoring system took me a while.\n\nEnd C++ solution (to replace tuple of strings): I encode every actions/requirements/optional req/ME req as a 32 bits integer. For the names and instruments I generate a map to convert them to integers and back to string when outputting the best solution.",

    "content": "A minor suggestion would be to add numbers to the different parts of the score. That is: 1. Free Time, 2. Loud Instruments etc. I found myself many times going back and forth from the statement to the debug print, having to read a couple lines before finding where I was again.\n\n(SPOILER) On another note I solved it in rust without using any `_remember` equivalent. It is just substantially slow for some tests, taking ~5secs for the entire test suite. The point being that I was not aware of this technique, and I don't think it is mentioned in the playground (other than in documentation of `_process_row_selection` in the python code).\n\nIs there a simple problem/testsuite to implement this bit of logic? This puzzle has too many extra factors for me to delve on that part only.",
