    "content": "It's strange that the result is rounded, especially since there are different rounding rules when halfway. Specifically, these are to round up in this scenario, to round away from zero, or to round to even. Worse, the second test All Unique is the only case where this applies. It's not checked for in the validators.\n\nYou could just get rid of the rounding rule, by ensuring that the result is an integer which does not need rounding, or by asking for twice the median, or by multiplying the result by e.g. 10, or by always using an odd number of values so that the median never needs to be computed as an average. Or you could just ask for the result unrounded. Regardless, test any special cases.\n\nIf you keep the rounding rule, check that rounding is correctly applied in later rather than earlier tests and validators. You would also need to state how to round unless the results would always be rounded the same way regardless. E.g. 73.5 will round to 74 under any method.",
