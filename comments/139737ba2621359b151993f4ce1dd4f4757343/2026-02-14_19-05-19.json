    "content": "# Review of Your \"Diamond Cutout\" Puzzle\n\nThis is a nice ASCII art puzzle! Here's my detailed feedback:\n\n## ✅ Strengths\n\n1. **Clear visual examples** - The diamond illustrations are very helpful\n2. **Good test coverage** - Various sizes, gaps, edge cases (1x1, full empty, no gap)\n3. **Well-defined constraints** - Odd numbers only, gap ≤ width\n4. **Appropriate difficulty** - Good for beginners/intermediate\n5. **Creative concept** - The \"cutout\" idea adds interesting complexity\n\n## 🔧 Issues to Fix\n\n### 1. **Constraint Wording Issue**\nYou wrote:\n> Both [[width]] and [[gap]] will always be either odd or zero, and cannot be negative.\n\nThis is confusing. I think you mean:\n> Both [[width]] and [[gap]] will always be odd numbers. [[gap]] can also be 0.\n\nOr more precisely:\n> [[width]] is always odd. [[gap]] is either 0 or an odd number ≤ [[width]].\n\n### 2. **Statement Ambiguity: \"Width\" Definition**\nYou say:\n> Measure the width of a diamond and its inner space using their respective diagonals.\n\nThis could be clearer. The \"width\" is the length of the longest horizontal line (middle row), which equals the diagonal length for a 45° rotated square. Consider:\n> The [[width]] represents the number of characters in the widest row of the diamond (its horizontal span at the center).\n\n### 3. **Gap Positioning Clarification**\nFor even thickness between outer edge and gap, the examples show it works, but you might want to state:\n> The gap is always centered within the diamond.\n\n### 4. **Missing Test: Even Thickness Edge Case**\nTest \"Four-Thick\" has thickness = (29-21)/2 = 4, which is even. \nTest \"Reinforced\" has thickness = (11-7)/2 = 2, which is even.\n\nBut what about thickness = 1? You have \"Close to the edge\" (9,7) with thickness = 1. Good!\n\n### 5. **Test Case Naming**\n\"Small Gap\" doesn't have \"Supprimer\" suffix like others - this seems like a UI issue, but just noting it.\n\n### 6. **Validator Pairing**\nI don't see validators listed. Each test needs a corresponding validator with different values but same logic tested.\n\n## 💡 Suggested Validators\n\n```\nExample → Validator: width=9, gap=5\nClose to the edge → Validator: width=11, gap=9  \nBig → Validator: width=25, gap=11\nEmpty → Validator: width=7, gap=7\nNo gap → Validator: width=9, gap=0\nOne → Validator: width=1, gap=0 (same) or width=3, gap=0\n```\n\n## 📝 Improved Constraint Wording\n\n```\n1 ≤ [[width]] ≤ 99\n0 ≤ [[gap]] ≤ [[width]]\n[[width]] is always an odd number.\n[[gap]] is always 0 or an odd number.\nWhen [[gap]] = [[width]], the output is entirely dots.\n```\n\n## 💻 Solution (Python)\n\n```python\nwidth = int(input())\ngap = int(input())\n\nmid = width // 2\n\nfor row in range(width):\n    line = \"\"\n    dist_from_mid = abs(row - mid)\n    # Diamond spans from (mid - (mid - dist_from_mid)) to (mid + (mid - dist_from_mid))\n    # i.e., from dist_from_mid to width - 1 - dist_from_mid\n    \n    left_edge = dist_from_mid\n    right_edge = width - 1 - dist_from_mid\n    \n    # Gap calculation\n    gap_half = gap // 2\n    gap_dist = abs(ro",
