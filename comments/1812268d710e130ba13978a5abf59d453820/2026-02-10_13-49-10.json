    "content": "> Let me know if the problem statement is still confusing\nIf the statement contains \"That sounds confusing\" then it is confusing :p\nThe word \"pointer\" in particular is quite distracting and confusing, as it is usually associated with memory addresses and not just array indexes.\n\nThe examples clear it up perfectly of course, but having to figure out the requirements through examples instead of a simple statement is annoying, especially in \"fastest\" clashes. Concise, well-structured statement is important for those.\nExamples should ideally be clearly separated from the main statement with something like a bold heading, so you know you can skip reading them, or at least skim across them knowing they won't have some crucial extra requirement sneaked in.\n\nTake a list of N integers. Start at the first element (index 0) and repeatedly move following this rule: the value of the current element is the index of the next element you should move to. Will you ever return to the first element?",
