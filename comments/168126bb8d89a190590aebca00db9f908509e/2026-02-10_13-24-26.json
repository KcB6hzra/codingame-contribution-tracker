    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: The problem is simple but with lots of little things to get tripped up by and learn from like 0 cuts being high, iterating over the rows rather than the cuts, and how to represent the the key handle's static data. \nOnce you have the right model for how to approach the problem though it's an easy solve and has a lot of optimization potential by using advanced language features that the slower racers can learn from.\nVery fun concept and a fantastic clash of code problem.",

    "content": "Goal section:\n* Please specify that the key is represented using the character {{*}}, and the length of the handle is always {{4}}. Also, the bits are on the left and the handle is on the right, and the two parts are joined with {{**}}.\n\nInput section:\n* Please rewrite Line 1 description as \"An integer [[width]] for the key width\".\n* Please rewrite Line 2 description as \"A string [[specs]] for the key bitting depths from left to right, each character being a digit representing the bitting depth\".\n\nOutput section:\n* Please delete \"following\".\n\nConstraints section:\n* Please change the constraint as \"4 ≤ [[width]] ≤ 10\". The change is required because the representation of the key bitting depths will not work if width is greater than 10 (some bitting depths may have to be represented by 2-digit numbers).\n\nOptional:\n* In CG, height usually refers to the number of lines/rows while width usually refers to the number of columns. But you have used [[width]] to refer to the number of lines/rows, so it's a bit confusing to me. Not a big issue though, I guess.\n* In CG, usually when the inputs are a series of integers, they will be given as space-separated integers (e.g. 0 1 3 1) instead of a continuous string (e.g. 0131). Suggest you to change to that, but I guess it is still ok if you choose not to change it.",
