    "content": "Please remove the test case: \"That huge number\". I hate it when a clash goes out of its way just to push the limits of what a language is capable of handling natively. I can pass the validator and not the test case itself. Which will lead to one of those instances where you don't pass 100% of the tests when testing, yet you will pass 100% when you submit.\n\nMoreover, if the programmer decides to fix it (which in C++ would be done by using a string instead of an int), then that just takes time and can easily lose a fastest mode. Anyone who decides to first code this using numbers instead of strings with, let's say, C#, would instantly have the advantage since they'd pass all the tests with \"decimal\".\n\nOtherwise, it's a very good problem.",
