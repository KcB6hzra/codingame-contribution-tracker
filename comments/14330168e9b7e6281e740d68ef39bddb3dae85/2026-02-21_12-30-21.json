    "content": "General\n* Please study the formatting syntax on this page: https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/statement , and format your statement properly as described in the points below.\n\n* The clash currently lacks any key programming elements such as lists, sets, dictionaries, string manipulation, loops, conditions… Please add one or more programming elements so that the clash is more of a programming problem than a maths problem.\n\nGoal\n* The units for weight, dose, and drug concentration are not specified. Please clearly state the units.\n\n* The relationship between weight, dose, and concentration is not explained. Please describe how the volume is calculated from these values.\n\nInput\n* The description currently placed under \"Input\" actually describes the output. Please move it to the Output section.\n\n* Please refer to the earlier link for an example of how this section should be written.\n\nOutput\n* The content under \"Output\" contains constraints rather than an output description. Please move it to the Constraints section.\n\nStub generator / Constraints\n* Please use the same variable names in the stub generator and the Constraints section.\n\nConstraints\n* Please format all [[variables]].\n\n* Please change 150 and 500 to 100, because the inputs never exceed 100.\n\nThanks.",
