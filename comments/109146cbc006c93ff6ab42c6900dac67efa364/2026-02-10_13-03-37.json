The feedback from @Ayush-Kukreti and both of you has been really valuable in helping me refine my work. I’ve also removed unnecessary details and reworked the test cases to ensure they align better with the intended validator format.\n\nUnfortunately, I’ve encountered some issues with the site not updating my previous submission, so I will be creating a new one altogether after removing this. The revised version will reflect all the improvements discussed, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts once it’s live.\n\nThanks again for your patience and guidance!\n\n\n*Error I encountered\nOops\nAn error occurred (#572): \"You do not have the last contribution version\".",

    "content": "It may be a bit confusing to use the words \"path\" and \"steps\" as players may misunderstand the input string to be a map and try to calculate the position of the victim. Hence I'll suggest a few changes as follows:\n\nGoal\n* Suggest to change \"following symbols in their path\" to \"the victim's actions, represented by the following symbols\".\n\nInput\n* Suggest to change \"steps\" to \"actions taken to escape the room,\".\n\nConstraints\n* Please delete the two constraints as they are not relevant to the solution. (e.g. it's entirely possible that the victim must go only backwards to reach the exit. A really weird series of actions would be one which contains \"|\" only.)\n\n+++++\n\nIn addition, I would like to see some edge cases to check whether solutions distinguish ERROR or non-ERROR cases correctly or not.\n\nFor example, you may add a case of .<.. adds up to 10 seconds before adding the final 2 seconds, and hence should be a non-ERROR case. So, my suggestions are:\n\n* Change Faulty Cell Validator to contain actions which add up to less than 8 seconds (before adding the final 2 seconds).\n\n* Add a pair of cases where actions add up to exactly 8 seconds (before adding the final 2 seconds). The original case of ..< can be included here.\n\n* Add a pair of cases where actions add up to exactly 10 seconds (before adding the final 2 seconds). The example I gave above of .<.. can be included here.\n\nThanks.",
