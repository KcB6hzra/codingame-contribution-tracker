    "content": "Nice clash, few small suggestions:\n\n\"We simply ignore that some constants in some cases act as vocals. Eg. 'H' in hour and 'Y' in my, by, gym or bicycle.\"\nconstants -> consonants\nvocals -> vowels\n\nThe handling of case is a bit tricky since 'Abobcoc' could decrypt to 'Abc' or 'ABC' or 'ABc' or 'AbC'. It's more clear in the encryption than the decryption. This was a little bit confusing in-clash, so could perhaps be clarified.\n\nAlso, there's no test cases that actually ensure that you don't reduce *o* patterns where * is a vowel or other non-consonant character. e.g. you could have \"Rorioi\" -> \"Rioi\" and not \"Ri\". Currently you can just replace any (.)o\\1 pattern with \\1 and not worry about making sure the '.' is a consonant ([^aeiou\\d_\\W]). I kind of like that this isn't tested, as it made it easier in Shortest mode, but ideally you would want to test it otherwise all the explanation about consonants and vowels is irrelevant.",
