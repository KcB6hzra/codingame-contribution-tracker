    "content": "Three important points:\n[EDIT: all addressed in the current version]\n\n1) Mass and height are integers, but BMI is a float. Floats have limited precision, so the expression \"18.5 (included) and 25 kg/m2 (excluded)\" is meaningless: where you find 18.5 and 25 I may find 18.499999999 and 25.000000002 instead (https://floating-point-gui.de/errors/comparison/). None of your test cases are exactly on the edge, so you can just remove those specifications.\n\n2) the last line in the output description is unclear. One could rewrite the phrase in parentheses as \"(rounded up to the next integer: for example, if the result is 0.25, you should output 1)\"\n\n3) In the description you use THIN, but the tests use UNDERWEIGHT\n\nOther minor points:\n- to \"loose\" means to unfasten something that was tied up, you actually mean \"lose\"\n- I would replace his/he with \"he or she\" or \"them\" since you're referring to generic people",
