    "content": "This is cool, but I think it's a bit artificial to have incorrect guesses after already winning. e.g. your first example is won after guessing 'a' but then there is an 'x' guess afterwards. This would never happen in a real game and makes the puzzle unnecessarily harder (i.e. if you simply count the number of guessed letters that aren't in the word you get 4, but the correct hangman only has 3 appendages).\n\nI think this would be a nicer puzzle if you removed any superfluous guesses (including >6 incorrect guesses, since once you've lost you stop guessing).",
