    "content": "I know that this clash is to be in Reverse mode, so most of the changes here won't be seen by the clash players, but still, as you have written the statement, I would still like to improve it (except for point 5 which DOES affect the clash):\n1. Suggest to change \"1 - n\" to \"1 to n (both numbers inclusive)\" as the dash might be confused to be a minus sign.\n2. In the Goal section please specify that the numbers should be space-separated.\n3. I think you are printing the odd numbers first not the even numbers first as suggested in the Goal section?\n4. The last sentence in the Goal section may be deleted as it seems to bring confusion more than adding useful info.\n5. I don't think it's a good idea to require a space to be added to the end of the outputs, especially in Reverse mode...\n6. It's more natural to state 4 ≤ n ≤ 150 instead of the other way round in the Constraints section.",
