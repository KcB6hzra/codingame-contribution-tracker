Is input damage \"base damage\" that should be doubled if the element types match those stated in the rules? If yes, please mention that, and also specify in Input section that the damage given is \"base\" damage.\n\nInput\n* Please rewrite all descriptions in the following format:\n<<Line _:>> [variable type] [[variable_name]] [description]\n\nFor example, line 1 becomes:\n<<Line 1:>> An integer [[monsterHealth]] for the monster's starting health.\n\n* Please remove the extra space before \":\" for Line 3 and Line 6.\n\n* Line 6: \"aiELement\" should be changed to \"aiElement\".\n\nConstraints\n* You've mixed up > with <.
