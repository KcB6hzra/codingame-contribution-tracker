Or maybe you can write about a \"vertical cut\".\nThe \"0\" are very misleading too. A \".\" or space would be better.\n\"#\" is not a mountain, it is simply rocks that compose the mountain above it.\n\nAfter understanding, in fact you are only looking for the 0-index of the column with the most \"#\". If you have this as \"Goal\", it makes for a very good CoC.\n\nHere it is more a simple solo Puzzle once you have understood the problem.",

    "content": "I like this one. +1 from me. I golfed it with 55 characters.\n\nSome suggestions that should make your statement clearer:\n\n* Change the zeros in the inputs to spaces. That way it's much easier to see the mountain shape. That should make a huge difference, especially for reverse mode.\n* In the first example, the mountain isn't connected to the ground everywhere. That contrasts with all the test cases (so it might be confusing, especially in reverse mode). Consider connecting every peak in the first example to the ground.\n* Change the wording from tallest mountain to tallest peak everywhere.\n* Related to the above, if a position in the mountain range is not a peak, call it a column instead of a mountain.\n* Don't use \"range of hills\" in the first sentence. Use \"mountain range\" instead, like everywhere else.\n* Move the sentence \"There will be n lines, each consisting ...\" from the goal statement to the input statement, and rewrite it to fit in.\n* Move the first sentence of the example (\"The time it takes to reach the ith mountain...\") to the goal statement, between the other two sentences.\n* Remove the sentence \"You can't move across air\". I think it's unnecessary if you already say only horizontal distance counts.\n\nI have justifications for all these points. I left most of them out. Ask if you want to know.\nGood luck getting approvals!",

    "content": "\"first mountain in the first mountain\"? That's certainly some description...\n\nI finally see what you mean by mountains. It's so difficult to recognise the shapes of mountains among those 0 and # characters!\n\nI also misinterpreted the input as a MAP instead of a PHOTO. That's why I was thinking, \"oh, how do I move from one cell to another cell\"? Clear descriptions are important, dude!\n\nInput section\n* Please change \"map\" to \"photo\".\n\nGoal section\n* Suggest to change \"Mountain 1 is always the first mountain in the first mountain (first column)\" to:\n\nThe first column always contains a mountain and is denoted as Mountain 1. A mountain always starts on the ground (the bottom row) and continues up to its peak.\n\n* It also feels weird to describe each column as a single mountain. I would consider columns of mountain which are connected together as a single mountain range. It's more appropriate to describe the task as finding the time to reach the peak of any mountain range.\n\n* Also, the time you request to output takes into account only the horizontal distance and ignores any vertical (climbing) distance. That should be mentioned.\n\nThanks.",
