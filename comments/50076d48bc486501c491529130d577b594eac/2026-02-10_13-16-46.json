However, for beginners, it could be more engaging. It would be better to categorize this problem as a “shortest” rather than a “fastest” because it can be solved quickly using the “fastest” approach. Otherwise, everything is okay.",

However, please consider that this problem is designed for two things:\n• To be very quick to implement in fastest mode\n• To be very interesting in shortest mode (as Miphat_BallIl says above). Which is also nice for fastest mode: if you check my solution, it's definitely faster to implement it this way than simply checking the statement because you have less characters to type.",
