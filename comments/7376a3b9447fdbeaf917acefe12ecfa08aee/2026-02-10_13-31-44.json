    "content": "I like the clash, I think the non-conventional rules for the race make it fun. Just two suggestions:\n- I would change the validators to make each outcome more or less equally probable. Imagine I can't solve the problem at all, but simply submit \"output DRAW\", thinking \"well, at least I'll score around 30%\". With the current validators, I would still get a 75% score!\n- The expression \"closer (in any direction)\" made me wonder if directions perpendicular to the race path are also allowed: would in this 8x2 example the rabbit win because it's closer to the finish line in the vertical direction?\n##F###T#\n##R#####\nProbably I'm just overthinking it, but I would change \"in any direction\" with \"in either direction\"",
