As this can be also reverse, the examples really explains everything and in fastest mode you don't want to read a wall of unrelated text.\n\nTime wise I think it is fine, think it took me about 4-5 minutes, fiddling with the 1 based index, and I am probably not the fastest :)\n\nI like that it is very easy to understand and straightforward to code.\n\nI think it could be a nice addition especially for someone that a less experienced in algorithms.",
