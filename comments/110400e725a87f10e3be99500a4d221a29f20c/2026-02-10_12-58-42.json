It seems the cases should have been ordered differently, but if you'd prefer to keep the current order (especially if there are other reasons for the order), that's fine. We should just keep in mind that execution time is one of the factors to consider when deciding case order in future contributions. You may want to check again the case order in \"Snowflakes\", for example.",

Please split the cases into two pairs: one pair featuring Pac-Man with 0 energy on a non-empty grid, one pair featuring Pac-Man with positive energy on an empty grid (i.e. the grid contains just Pac-Man and empty space).\n\n* \"No Moves\" (test) and Validator 6: In the test, Pac-Man cannot move because of barriers. In the validator, Pac-Man cannot move because of ghosts. Please revise both cases so that each case features both, i.e. two sides of Pac-Man are blocked by barriers and the other two sides are essentially blocked by ghosts.\n\n* 80x80 grids seem to be a waste because of the [[energy]] limit of 25, which means the maximum accessible area of Pac-Man is only 50x50. Suggest to either reduce the maximum grid size (say 60x60) and/or increase the [[energy]] limit if possible.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "It's natural for Part 2 of a two-part puzzle to have a higher success rate, since typically only those who have completed Part 1 will proceed to Part 2.\n\nAdditionally, as mentioned earlier, we should observe the data over a longer period. The current bases (the total number of people who have started each puzzle) are still quite small (fewer than 100 for all three). A larger population size will provide a more reliable indicator of the puzzles' difficulty levels.\n\nHope this clarifies! 🙂",

The aim is to test whether the player's code correctly counts each fruit item once only.\n\nThis idea also leads me to another question: do the current cases cover all types of wrap-around movements (i.e. across all four edges)?",

    "content": "Could you expand on your first point? I'm slightly confused on the meaning.\nMy interpretation is you're referring to a new/related puzzle with something like:\n* #*   4#5 <= Valid   ##* <= Invalid as one fruit is unvisited\n) # *   7#6                  . # .\n###   ###                 ###\nP # .   P#1                 P#*\n.  # *  3#2                 *#*\nOutput potentials: Number of ways to visit every fruit once / boolean - is it possible? / number of unvisited fruits etc. Let me know if I'm way off though...\n\nThe cases do test all wrap-arounds with the most involving 3 wraps to solve. Examples: Validator 8 tests both vertical wraps, Validator 13 and 14 contains left and right wraps respectively. The test and validators pairs don't check the exact same wraps (e.g. Complex 3 test left=>Right and bottom=>top while it's validator checks right=>left and bottom=>top). If they need to match exactly I can change and/or add a case involving all 4 wraps.",

    "content": "Gotcha!(maybe...) Most test/validators requires the player to have kept track of visited/eaten fruit and only count it once. If this wasn't the case, the solution would only need to find the nearest instances of each type of fruit, traverse to each, then move on and off to accumulate score then select the max score between them. If you're referring to a case where ALL the fruit is eaten and ensure that it's only counted once, then no, there is no test case currently for this.\n\nA few thoughts have come to mind based on your example:\nGiven a small grid with large energy, it's possible to navigate the entire grid with and without the use of wrapping. Both methods provide the same score of 34. However, the minimum energy used for non-wrap routes is 23 but the minimum energy used for a wrapping route is 21. Taking this into account, the 'best' solution is the one with the highest score and with the most energy remaining - tired Pac-Man doesn't want to move if he doesn't get any score out of it :( Additionally, there are a total of 95 routes that provide 34 as an answer. These two pieces of information could be used for additional outputs or do you think it's unnecessary?\n\nValidators - I'll alter to ensure that all wraps are in visible tests and their corresponding validators check the same wraps. Also, I will add your example case of a small grid with large energy including 4 wraps.",

And I think it'll be good to add a pair of cases where ALL the fruit is eaten and the player must ensure that each is counted once only.\n\n(2)\nIf in most cases Pac-Man will use up all the initial energy, then it doesn't seem necessary to request the additional output because it'll be merely repetition. (An alternative is to request the output of minimum energy used only when Pac-Man can eat all the fruit without consuming all the initial energy, but it may complicate things and I personally don't prefer that. But it's up to you.)\n\n(3)\nOK! Just let me know when you've updated the cases, and I'll review them again.\n\nThanks!",
