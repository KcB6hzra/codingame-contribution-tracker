It's a problem that can be simplified very easily, could even be solved in under 1 min if someone gets it quickly.\n\nA few problems:\n\n- LAN parties are now old fashioned :(\n\n- I've never heard the word \"dividers\" being used in this context before. Normally people call them power bars or extension cords.\n\n- \"read divsockets string(40)\" should probably be \"loopline nDividers div_sockets:int\"\n\n- number of sockets should probably have a > 0 constraint, but that's a minor detail",

Over here we all call it dividers, but ricemath already pointed me to the fact that this is actually not the correct naming, so based on his suggestion I shifted to extension cords.
