This guarantees that a player who picks a low tile on turn N plays earlier on turn N+1 and gets more opportunities to pick higher tiles.\nConversely a player who picks a high tile on turn N will play later on turn N + 1 and gets a more restricted choice because other players will have picked first.\nSo players need to balance between getting the tiles they need, preventing others from getting tiles they need and securing play order to avoid getting crappy leftovers.",

For 3 and 4 players there is no other choice since each player only has one tile to play, so it's simpler to also use ID order for 2 players rather than make a particular case.\n\nAlso, using pick order for 2 players would just determine the order in which one player carries out his two turns, but not the order of play between players, so it would mean adding another rule for that. ID order determines both in one go.\n\nNote that ID order is important because placing the first tile may potentially prevent you from placing the second one, forcing you to discard it, so you have to take that in consideration when picking for 2 players.",
