    "content": "This feels a bit arbitrary. Its not possible for clashers to know what you could include in your validators. I appreciate your statement in the constraints (which should probably be in the statement), but thats not going to help someone who is solving this as a reverse puzzle. You could put in the statement: \"The sequence is always going to be either an arithmetic sequence (i.e. x(i+1) = X + x(i)) or a geometric sequence (i.e. x(i+1) = R*x(i))\". But its too arbitrary when trying to solve this as a reverse puzzle. Let me know what your reaction to that is. (Also this is pretty similar to some other clashes that have been done before but since its up to the clasher to determine which type it is it seems unique enough.)",
