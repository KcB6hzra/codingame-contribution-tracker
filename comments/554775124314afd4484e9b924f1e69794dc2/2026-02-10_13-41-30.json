    "content": "Why are the empty squares denoted by a 'X' and not a dot '.' as in any other puzzle of this kind?!\nWhy isn't the rover denoted by a < > ^ v to indicate the direction it is facing initially?\nIs the '#' really necessary (no) or just confusing (yes)? (Why not activate the breaks to stop in the middle of each \"F R\" then?)\n\nThese are general design remarks, but the amount of poor arbitrary choices that one has to guess in reverse mode is particularly concerning.",
