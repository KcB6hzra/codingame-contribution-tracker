    "content": "Thanks for the feedback! \nActually, while the provided test cases are indeed PHP source files, knowledge of PHP is no pre-requisite at all. Solution would be very similar for analysing C, C++, C#, Java and Javascript source (only difference is the set of reserved keywords and how user-defined functions can be detected). (I edited the statement to emphasize this more.)\nOriginally, I was considering to make the puzzle more general (e.g. getting the list of reserved keywords as part of input), but later discarded it, because statement is already complicated enough. Another reason: even if it would support several input languages, some other languages with very different syntax would still be left out. \nSo, if a Python coder is not ready to step out of their comfort zone, they can skip this puzzle.",
