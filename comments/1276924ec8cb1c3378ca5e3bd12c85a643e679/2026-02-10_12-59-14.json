    "content": "Thanks, I've changed the constraint and implemented the last suggestion.\n\nAdding more impossible cases is something I'm avoiding for now though, because it makes submitting 'print(\"Impossible\")' more and more likely to get a medium score/rank in Fastest mode. To offset this, I'd need to make more tests with real outputs, but I feel like 10 is already about as many as a clash should have before it gets annoying...\n\nThe impossible cases are symmetric with respect to the time zone difference (e.g. +6 = -6, -16=+8=-8=+16 -- all of these are impossible). So in that sense the only impossible case I've not covered is -7=+7, but I figured by testing 6 and 8 I was ensuring clashers got both 'edges' of the impossible zone and would naturally have the inside too. If I really wanted to cover every impossible case I'd need at least 3 impossible cases (6,7,8), 6 if I want to account for +/- and 12 if I want to account for -16/+16, -17/+17, -18/+18. I could halve it by testing for different differences in validators vs tests, but I wanted to avoid that...",

I figured all CG languages have access to a string formatter like `sprintf`, but there's a lot of langs I'm not familiar with.\n\n24-hour time is ideal here and it's customary to use HH:MM format, so I'm hesitant to change it but the clash is already on the hard side, so I see the value of removing the formatting obstacle for outputs.\n\nEdit: I decided to just change it. Making this a bit less complicated will help newer coders solve it within 15 minutes. Thanks for the suggestion.",
