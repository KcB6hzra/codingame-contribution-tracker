So either this should be stated, or (probably better), the test cases should be crafted to avoid having answers exactly (or almost exactly...) at x.yz5.",

    "content": "Interesting puzzle, even though it's more of a textbook physics problem than an algorithm puzzle.\n\nI edited to improve the stub.\n\nWhen asked for a 2-decimal precision, one expects to always provide these 2 decimals. Here (since you rely on the default behavior of Python) you should mention that you don't want trailing 0s in the output.\n\nTestcases are a bit weak. First, there should be more than 1 \"normal\" case.\nAlso, there is a missing particular case: Consider for instance the \"normal\" testcase and inverse the speed. The solution should be (no collision):\n2.63 1.04\n1.29 0.56\nBut your solution code gives:\n1.63 0.11\n2.29 1.49\nI would suggest to add such a case (and fix your code).",

This problem can be calculated analytically, without errors  or the need for epsilons, etc.",

    "content": "Hello WildSmilodon,\n\nI'm sorry for the delay in responding.\nI think you are right, the limit defines the stop position, there are two ways to interpret this:\n\nOn one hand, the ball does not really stop (because the velocity would never reach 0 with the model we chose).\nOn the other hand, we can consider that a ball is stopped when we cannot detect any movement by sight.\n\nI won't specify the \"epsilon\" here, I think it's a kind of repetition.",
