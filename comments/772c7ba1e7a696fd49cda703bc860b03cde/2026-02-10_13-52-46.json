    "content": "I managed to almost reliably validate Test 6 in time with a byte-compiled OCaml code that works basically the same way as your code does with a small supplementary optimisation. The first and third test cases of Test 6 are noticeably more computationally expensive than the rest of the test.\n\nOn the other hand it’s not even close when I try Validator 6, mainly because the first test case is outstandingly expensive to compute, taking nearly as much time by itself as the entire Test 6. I’m afraid you will need to reduce the complexity of these test-cases a bit again.\n\nI don’t think you should be worried about the problem getting too easy to solve, because CYK is a pretty straightforward algorithm anyway; there are indeed a few optimizations to add to the solution that just naively iterates against all production rules to decide which to apply, and it gives an appreciable performance boost, but it doesn’t get much further AFAIK.\n\nIf you wish to provide a difficult challenge about context-free grammars, I would suggest making two parts out of this problem:\n— The first one would be this one, being mostly about understanding the notion of formal grammars and recognizing phrases with the CYK algorithm, with Test 6 being a bit easier, and Validator 6 without the first test which seems to take a particularly long time to complete.\n— The second one though would be using even more complex grammars and test-cases, and hence would be out of range of the CYK algorithm in any case; solving the problem would require implementing a generalized LR parser for example (I have only lightly skimmed over the subject).\n\n\nI will happily validate this puzzle when you think it is ready. Good job!",
