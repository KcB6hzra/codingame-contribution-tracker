    "content": "Great puzzle.\n\nTwo notes:\n- I expected harder-to-find expectancy bounds. Like, not the bruteforce you do in your author example.\n- failing that, I half-expected (but started without implementing) longer Ys than is feasible to implement in O(Y).\n\nI'll also report my code was in a state where it succeeded everything but V4, and that's a very frustrating state to have it in. It ended up in a age/number swap that's obviously my own damn fault, and I'm not quite sure how it could have been prevented by the tests, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nApproving.\n\nCan we hope for the double-harder variant soon?",
