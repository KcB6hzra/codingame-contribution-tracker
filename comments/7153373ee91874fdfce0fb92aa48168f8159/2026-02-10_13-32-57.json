    "content": "I like it, it's an original idea. Maybe it would be simpler if the colour codes were already in the RGB format so that the players may go straight into making the \"fun\" part of the program (hexadecimal to decimal conversion is something that most coders know how to do, and plus there are functions such as int(\"FF\", 16) in Python that instantly give the decimal value). All in all, it definitely seems Clash of Code worthy!",
