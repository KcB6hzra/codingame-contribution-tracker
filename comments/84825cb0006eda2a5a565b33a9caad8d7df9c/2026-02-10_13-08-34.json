Current wording of statement 'within' is somewhat ambiguous. Maybe rephrase as \"when the average [[duration]] it takes to solve is less than or equal to CondinGame's ...\"\n- While solving, I was wondering whether I would encounter corrections_made>corrections_offered, and what I would have to do with it. I think it is not included; maybe include it in the constraints? (0<=corrections_made<=corrections_offered<=20 would do that I think)",

I'll leave that for others to decide.\n\nCases\n* Please change Validator 1 to cover the case where only one condition is satisfied, similar to Test 1.\n\n* Currently both Test 2 and Validator 2 covers the case of a contribution satisfying conditions 1 and 3. Please add two more pairs of cases to cover the situations of satisfying conditions 1 and 2 and conditions 2 and 3.\n\n* When you add the above cases, please make sure these is at least one test and one validator where upvotes is positive while downvotes is zero.\n\nThanks.",

I just thought that it would add an irrelevant detail to the Test-cases, which would allow me to add some text to the clash.\nBecause I added this variable, I was able to self-promote my clashes (please see Test 1, Test 2 and Validator 2) and mention you in this clash (please see Validator 3, which is soon to be public as Test 3👈🤫)",
