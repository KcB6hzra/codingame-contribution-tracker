    "content": "Goal section\n* I guess \"non-null\" is not required, as the description \"positive\" is already sufficiently clear. Alternatively, please change it to \"non-zero\".\n* \"Exemple\" should be spelled as \"Example\".\n* The example doesn't really explain anything. Please either expand it or remove it.\n\nOutput section\n* You may format \"none\" as a {{constant}} and remove the quotation marks.\n* The condition for outputing \"none\" or nothing is NOT \"result of the maximum value is equal to 0\". The condition should be when there are no such pairs of [[a]] and [[b]] which satisfy the condition that a and b are both positive integers. Please amend the description in both lines.\n\nSolution code\n* This does not really affect the clash, but I notice that the condition in the middle (if r == \"none\") will never be triggered as r will never be a string.\n\nThanks.",
