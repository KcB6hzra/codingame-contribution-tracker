    "content": "Horrible. I'm very salty.\nNowhere mentioned that angles should sum up to 360 or they not gonna compose a cyclic quadrilateral.\nAnd no test cases where the sum of all angles equals 360 but the sum of the two opposite angles are not the same for both pair of angles.\n\nI've edited so it's all good now.\n\nYou may argue that specifying that sum of all angles makes it too easy. I'll answer that if you gonna put a definition of a term in the statement you should put all relevant info in here. Not a part of it but all of it. Or at least specify that it's Euclidean geometry so It's not ambiguous. Becouse in non-Euclidean geometry you can have sum of all angles in cyclic quadrilateral be >360.\n\nImagine the amount of frustration I've got when a test failed just because I've assumed that I've been given a full definition. Got 88%. Checked out the solution of the 100% first place and it's the 'check if all sum is 360' solution that shouldn't even work.",
