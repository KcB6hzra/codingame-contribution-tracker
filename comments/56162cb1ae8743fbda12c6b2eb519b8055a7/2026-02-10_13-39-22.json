    "content": "Let me start off by saying that this is incredibly well done.\nI had some issues with the input initially - but it has been resolved.\nIt's not the most friendly puzzle to debug, but there's lots of information, so that's to be expected. I fought much more with autoplay than anything else to be honest. I finally have solution which is able to solve some games, but it seems I still have something wrong with home moves removal so I had to remove few home moves manually to see if my solution works - luckily it does.\n\nFeedback for the puzzle:\n\n1) In my opinion the most important one - ability to turn off autoplay, as currently there's much more issue than gain with it.\n\n2) Detailed description about how the autoplay works - in order to solve the puzzle you have to remove those moves which will be auto-played, unless someone is trying to find a new solution each turn and providing only one turn per move (guess that's possible, but I've used python and haven't tried that approach)\n\n3) Information about turn time limit and maximum allowed moves in total in description - it's really nice to have as it's a great and quick way to judge how advanced solution you probably have to write (for example with easy puzzles you often know that you can use bruteforce if the puzzle spec has small inputs)\n\n4) Very minor - maybe add information in the output which move is being executed on a certain turn (and when a turn is auto-play)? Mostly an issue with readability while trying to watch the game slowly and outputing multiple moves in a single turn, easily fixed by player when he outputs a single move per turn.\n\nMore than happy to approve in few days, once I'll have a bit more time to remove my home moves issue in my code and maybe some optimizations are still required to solve harder games. Great job!",

It'll get there. Eventually.\n(2) ditto.\n(3) they're the platform defaults. I haven't actually thought about them, what settings do you think would make sense? IIRC the platform constraints are: <=30s aggregated per game, >=50ms per turn.\n(4) great idea.  That might actually come up first as it's easiest to implement.",
