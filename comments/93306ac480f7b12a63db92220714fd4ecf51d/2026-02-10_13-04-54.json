Remove the possibility of roommates completely, just have clashers compare whether Ruby can afford these places on her own with the expenses each one would have, removing the \"bed_bath\" part from the inputs.\n2. At least remove the bathrooms part and just have the number of bedrooms and assume that's the number of roommates she can have.\n3. The extra string manipulation needed for 0 roommates to become \"no\" roommates is small, but for an already tough clash it could be the difference between finishing at 14m50s and not finishing at all.\n\nI really think if you want people to solve this in 5-10 minutes, then you should simplify it to option 1.
