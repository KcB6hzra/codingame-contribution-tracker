Permutations and combinations primarily deal with ordering or selecting elements from a set, typically involving counting different arrangements. They are the main focus here, since this puzzle is about whether it is possible to cover a space rather than counting possibilities.",

For reference, see how other puzzle statements are presented.\n2. duplication of several lines in statement and input can be avoided\n3. Prefer to have more sets of test cases.  For binary answers, it takes only 2^4 random trials in average to pass 4 validators. To prevent blind guesses, refer to some of my puzzles that each test case is composed of multiple tests.\n4. I doubt is the max limit 30 too lenient. Can a reasonable code handle a hundred or even a thousand blocks? I haven't done the coding so this is just a guess.",
