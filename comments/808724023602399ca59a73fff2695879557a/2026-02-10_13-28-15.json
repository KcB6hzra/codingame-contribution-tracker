    "content": "I think the puzzle is great. Nevertheless I have two remarks:\n- I would personally prefer explaining how to get the parity of a group that way: \"the parity of a group is defined as the parity of the sum of their bits\" (I think it is up to the player to think about a way to figure out the parity, the only thing to know about it is that one has to consider the sum of the bits, isn't it?).\n- in test 5, I had a problem implementing it in Python, because the answer was rejected because of the '\\n' put after \"ERROR\" when using print(\"ERROR\"), so I had to specify print(\"ERROR\",end=''). I think this point should definitely be fixed somehow before approving.\n\nAnyway, good job and thank you for this puzzle!",
