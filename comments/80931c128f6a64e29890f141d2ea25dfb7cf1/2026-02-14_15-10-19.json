This is also related to second comment on Constraints below.\n\nConstraints\n* The constraint on [[F]] is incomplete.\n\n* Maybe add a constraint that all the coefficients of {{x}} within each sin/cos term appear in the output expression once only? Otherwise you would have to explain the order to adopt in such a case (e.g. whether it should be cos(x)+sin(x) or sin(x)+cos(x)).\n\nCover picture\n* Suggest to upload a cover picture for the puzzle.\n\nThanks.",

The thing is that the base is always e, and the power always something times ix, so you can simply deal with a single integer. I can't see what you lack to be able to do test 1/2/3/4 but not 5/6/7/8, the numbers simply grow bigger",
