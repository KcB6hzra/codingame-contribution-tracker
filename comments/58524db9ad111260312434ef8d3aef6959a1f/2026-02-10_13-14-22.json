    "content": "I think the statement could use more explanation. It assumes that the clasher is familiar with what Bingo is and how it works. You don't explain at any point that 'N33' means you need a 33 in your 'N' column. Also, the Free square didn't seem to have any impact other than reducing the necessary matches from 25 to 24.\n\nI got this as a clash just now and even though I'm familiar with Bingo, it was quite hard to figure out exactly what to do to solve this problem. In particular I think it's important to clarify that the Free spot doesn't need to be filled by a number. I initially thought that the Free spot could be filled with any number that was preceded by 'N', since it is in that column, but then it turns out you just ignore it completely in the solution, and only need 24 balls to win.",
