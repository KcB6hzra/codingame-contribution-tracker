    "content": "This is a nice problem. I don't think it was too easy because you had to find a way to track which specific segments turned off or on rather than just looking at the total number of segments per number.\n\nIf you still feel like it should be a little harder (which, IMO, it shouldn't for a clash), you could specify that leading zeroes in the first position will not be shown on the clock (meaning, for example, 00:59 gets displayed as 0:59 where all the segments on the leftmost digit are off)\n\nYou may also want to specify that the segments for the 1 display are all on the right-side edge and not on the left.",

    "content": "Looking at it from a beginners perspective, I think the problem is a little more complicated than that.  The output is looking for the number if segments that have stayed activated when switching by one minute.  For some of the numbers it would easy. \nExample:  0 to 1.  This would be four segments turning off therefore two remain activated.  A person would do the math to say a zero has 6 segments and a one has 2 segments, so the change is 4. (6-2=4)\nHowever from 2 to 3, both have five segments activated to represent the number, but 4 stayed activated while making the transition so it would be a 1.",
