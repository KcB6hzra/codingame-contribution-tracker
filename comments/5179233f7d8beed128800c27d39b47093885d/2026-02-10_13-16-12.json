    "content": "Uuhm - is this not basically 'take the second half of the string, put it up front'? Based on the statement my interest was raised, but then the eventual need was a bit disappointing.\n\nHow about:\n- first part of the string, reverse it one time\n- second part of the string, reverse it two times\nYou could even introduce a variable x: split the string in x parts, and each part i must be reversed i times. Eg x = 5:, with parts i=1 to i=5:\n- first part  must be reversed 1 time,\n- second part must be reversed 2 times,\n...\n- fifth part must be reversed 5 times.",

In such a case, \"first half\" and \"second half\" are not well-defined.\n\n(You may refer to this clash as a reference:\nhttps://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/44277c977ebad04564d3126a32fcc923ee69 )\n\nInput section\n* Please delete \"of the type abcdef\" because the meaning is unclear.\n\nOutput section\n* Again, unclear meaning (send what? \"himself\"?). Please just write \"the new string generated based on the requirement in the statement\".\n\nConstraints section\n* Please fix the typo: \"lenght\" => \"length\".\n\n* Please state the lower limit of the length.\n\n* Please state a more reasonable upper limit of the length, e.g. 100, instead of 10000. (The longest length of your cases is just 40.)\n\nCases\n* Test 5 and Validator 5 are the same. Please revise them so that they are different.\n\nThanks.",
