    "content": "Goal section\n* It's better to add a reminder that each line in the grid may have different widths (i.e. number of characters).\n\n* And, arising from the point above, is it correct to say that a vertical movement is still possible even if there is no character in the path? e.g. in Validator 4, can I go from D by up and then right to X even though there is no character above D?\n\nThis may have to be clarified in Goal section.\n\n* Suggest to delete \"(or - consists out of two movements: vertical and horizontal)\" - I feel that this just adds more confusion than explanation :P\n\nCases\n* Not sure if using whitespaces is a good idea here... Maybe using a character such as {{.}} will help the players visualise things better?\n\nThanks.",
