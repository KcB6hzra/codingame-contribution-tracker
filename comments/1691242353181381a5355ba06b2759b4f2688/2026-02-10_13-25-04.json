    "content": "Nice clash, a touch on the hard side since you have to do shadok conversion both ways AND solve the 'minimum coins'/'coin change' problem in the same clash.\n\nMy only actual issue though, is that in my clash I found that clashers could get 50% by just submitting:\nconsole.log(readline().split(\" \")[0])\nbecause the first two validators' answer is simply the first shadok word in the input (it actually gets 75% on the test cases).\n\nIt would be good to add more tests/validators to avoid this easy way to get a high percentage without coding anything.\n\nI was the only person to solve it in my clash (Shortest mode). But two clashers got 50% with <40 character code. The other two clashers got 0%. https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/411966321766fcd05a408b410cbd18e843d1ced",
