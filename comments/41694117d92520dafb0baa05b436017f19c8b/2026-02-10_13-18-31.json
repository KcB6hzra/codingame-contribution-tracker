    "content": "I like your puzzle, but I think the test cases are a bit too easy. I quickly put together a little recursive, brute force algorithm and easily passed all the test cases and validators. Pretty impressive, right? Actually, no. Your solution is 2000 (yes, two thousand) times faster than mine on Test 6.  \n\nI don't really want to study your code since I should be learning what to do on my own, but I see you have a \"dp\" variable and I'm guessing you're doing some dynamic programming. If that is true, here's what I'd like to see:\n\n1) If you are doing dynamic programming, add it to the tags to give us newbies a push in the right direction.\n\n2) Consider making the test cases harder so a guy like me has to learn something cool rather than still getting a passing grade with a shockingly slow algorithm.",

I'm a bit embarrassed how long it took me to do it properly, but that is probably what makes this a medium puzzle.\n\nYour entire puzzle is worded nicely and reads well.  I just have one thing I'd like to suggest.  I'd like the names of your test cases to present as nicely as the rest of your puzzle.  I don't care what the validators are named, but the test case names are part of the presentation.  You have 5 test cases that will be presented to the Codingamer.  I'd like you to change the names of those 5 test cases to something like:\n\nSimple\nStill Simple\nMedium\nGetting Harder\nLots of Numbers!\n\nOther than that, I'm ready to approve.",
