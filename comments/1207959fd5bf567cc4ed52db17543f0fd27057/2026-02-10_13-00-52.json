    "content": "I like the idea but I think it would be better to have some kind of explanation for the calculation, and the sum of the volumes or the surfaces of the resulting spheres could make some kind of sense.\n\nTo justify the surface, I was thinking of something like: humanity has created hollow worlds in deep space, spherical habitats where humans live on the inside of terraformed spheres. As population grows, the habitats need to be expanded one by one, starting from the older one. Assuming 100 inhabitants per square km, how many humans can live once all spheres have been expanded to their maximum size (neglecting the thickness of the hulls).",

    "content": "Just to clarify: only the spheres whose radius has been expanded contribute the cube of their radius to the total, right? For example, if a sphere expands and touches another, the second sphere won't expand in turn, since it's already in contact with another sphere, and therefore won't add its cubed radius to the total.\n\nEdit: Nevermind, I got it. Every sphere's radius has to be added. Maybe you could remove the \"expanded\" in the output section ?",

    "content": "To elaborate on my previous comment, the second constraint currently suggests that x, y, and z can be negative (and r can be zero). However, all existing cases feature only non-negative coordinates. Therefore, the constraint should be revised accordingly. Alternatively, you may include cases with negative coordinates, in which case the constraint should still explicitly specify the appropriate lower limit.\n\nThanks.",
