You can picture a DoughSquare that's 30 inches and imagine a 3 inch biscuit -- that makes sense.\nAnd it makes me (hopefully you too) giggle when I imagine the more absurd ones like a 0.2 inch biscuit (why bother!!) or a DoughSquare that is over 8 feet wide (I'm gonna need a bigger kitchen table!!)\n\nI agree that technically cut out probably should be two words, but my thinking was that hyphenating it made it easier to read.  At least that's how I read things: When something is hyphenated I read it as one word.  And a biscuit cutter doesn't really cut (as one normally thinks of scissors or a knife cutting) ; it \"cuts out\".\nWithout the hyphen, the phrase \"a Frugal Baker cut out than a Wasteful Baker\" becomes clumsy (\"cut out than\") and I wanted to avoid that.\n\nI definitely see your points, but I think I will pass on making the changes.  Thanks again for you approval.",
