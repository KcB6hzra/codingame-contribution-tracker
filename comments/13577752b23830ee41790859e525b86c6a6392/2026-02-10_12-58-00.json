    "content": "I think the problem is good, but it still lacks a bit of clarity about what to do if the time is an exact hour. I would recommend one of the following changes:\n1) Change the wording in point #4 to say \"If the time is closest to or exactly the start of the hour...\"\n2) Add a new condition for exact hour times in the goal, and add/change test cases. This could be something like \"exactly [hour]\", \"[hour] o'clock\", or just \"[hour]\".",

    "content": "Rules 4 and 5 may be confusing; there is no explicit specification for what to classify the exact hour (XX:00) as, and the difference between the start hour mark and the end hour mark is not defined. I would suggest combining the two rules under \"closest to the hour mark\", then further branch from there (before/after the hour mark).\n\nNot sure what the original format looked like before @5DN1L commented, but I would rephrase the rules to something like:\n3. ... [NEXT hour].\n4. Else, the time must be closest to the 0/60 minute mark. If the time lies <<strictly before>> the 0/60 minute mark, you'd say {{around [NEXT hour]}}. Otherwise, you'd say {{around [hour]}}.\n\nAs for the formatting of the [hour] variable, you could consider using your input notation in the problem statement:\nYou are given a time in <<12-hour format>> as [[h]]{{:}}[[mm]] {{AM}}/{{PM}}. Let [[nh]] be the <<next hour>> after [[h]] (ignoring AM/PM). E.g., [[h]] = 7 -> [[nh]] = 8; [[h]] = 12 -> [[nh]] = 1.\nYour task is to convert...\n1. ... {{half past}} [[h]].\n2. ... {{quarter past}} [[h]].\n3. ... {{quarter to}} [[nh]].\n...",

    "content": "I've made most of the requested changes. For the formatting around [hour] in the problem statement, I've left the square brackets as they are. It was intentional to not format that text as a variable, as its purpose is to convey that there should be a number (the hour) in that spot, not a variable name. If you have a suggestion for a better way to communicate that, let me know. I've also left test/validator 7 unchanged, even though the test and the validator are the same - 12:53 is a specific edge case (if the program has an off-by-one error in the logic around 'looping' the hour over back around to 1), so I think it should be both a test and a validator. Lastly, I've made the specified changes to the other validators; I didn't previously understand that the validators should 'line up' with the corresponding tests; is there a reason you requested those specific changes to tests/validators 6 and 12?\n\nThanks.",

I didn't receive a notification from the system, and just a reminder that in order for me or others to be notified, you'll need to reply to an existing comment rather than starting a new one.\n\nRegarding the use of \"[hour]\", since it's intended as a placeholder for the actual hour to be filled in, it should be treated as a variable rather than a constant. The current formatting would be more appropriate if the literal string \"[hour]\" were meant to appear in the output.\n\nAlso, @User123 made an excellent suggestion in the last part of their comment about how to format the [hour] variable. Please consider adopting those and updating the section accordingly.\n\nWhile you mentioned that test/validator 7 was unchanged, I noticed that the test is now different from the validator, which is exactly what I was hoping to see and aligns with your intended scenario. As for the specific changes I requested for test/validators 6 and 12, the reason is that the scenarios covered by those times were also featured in other cases, whereas the updated times (falling exactly on 15 and 30 minutes) weren't tested anywhere else.",
