Given a rectangle of size X*Y, you have to split it into smaller rectangles such that you maximize points for their size, points being determined by the input map : in the provided example, a 1*1 \"rectangle\" counts as 7 points, a 2*1 counts as 8, a 1*2 counts as 10, 2*2 counts as 42 ... and so on. You could split your initial rectangle in many 1*1 subparts but then the gain would only we of 7 * 4 * 5 = 140, far from the high score of 231",
