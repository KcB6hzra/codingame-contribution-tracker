    "content": "There are several problems with this clash. As other have mentioned:\n\n1. The tests and validators don't match. Leading to clashers getting 100% on tests then 83% on validators.\n\n2. The description is incorrect and misleading. It says \"[the] frog jumps following the order [...] [jump1, jump2, ...]\" when it actually jumps according to the integer listed at the position of the array where it is before jumping.\n\n3. The validator that leads to 83% is \"Long Array jump stay in after 100 jumps with little jumps\" which is the only one that makes use of the 100 jump rule. It is also coded with an incorrect answer, since the frog ends up outside of the array on the 100th jump, landing at position 100, in an array from 0..99. So the answer should be 100, not -1.",
