    "content": "I found an unexpected solution by accident.  After I solved it in Ruby, I wanted to try a slightly different solution in Python.  I accidently found that you don't need to store a sorted answer or to rotate the piles to find the cycle distance.  \n\nIn example 3 Turn 2 and Turn 6 are cyclic because 3 2 2 and 2 2 3 are the same but you wouldn't be able to see that unless you rotated (or sorted, still not sure why sorting works and doesn't give you false positives).  \n\nBut the strange thing I found is that if you keep going Turn 7 [1 1 2 3] and then Turn 8 [1 2 4], now Turn 8 is exactly the same as Turn 4 without sorting or rotating. Now if you take the total turn count (8) minus the index of [1 2 4] (4) you end up with the answer of 8-4=4.  And this works for all the test cases.  Why?",

    "content": "Interesting.\n\nWhat I found confusing:\n- It's a card name, yet the card values are never used. It could just as well be a rock game.\n- Your example makes it seem like we're supposed to keep the number of piles constant, whereas it doesn't seem to make much sense wrt the actual solution (or your author code)\n- An example with a loop size of one is a bit light.\n- Your validator 4 is titled \"Test 8\".",
