    "content": "I got this problem in Reverse mode. It's actually doable, but the \"MASTER COMRADE, NICE JOB!!!!\" obfuscates it for no reason. I suggest making a separate puzzle for Reverse mode with a more explicit output.\n\nIn particular, there is only one testcase with MASTER COMRADE, and it's a testcase with only one ip address, and a particularly suspicious ip address at that (ip addresses that start with 10 are usually private). So this testcase really doesn't help understanding what the MASTER COMRADE output is about. For Reverse mode this is really not enough!!\n\nAlso, I got 100% on the testcases but only 33% on the validators. In more than 500 clashes this is my first time having such a big difference between tests and validators, and especially for Reverse mode it's a very unsatisfying feeling. When I saw the results I thought that maybe this was actually a cryptography problem with something encoded in the ip addresses by the Master Comrade person, and that I just correctly got the testcases by accident without understanding the problem at all.\n\nI suggest reworking the tests and validators so they go together better. Especially for Reverse mode. For instance, Test5 is about only 1 ip, with a negative number, but Validator5 has several ip and is completely unrelated to negative numbers. And test2 is about an invalid address table, but validator 2 is about Master Comrade! This is not consistent!",

    "content": "Nice clash.\n\nI found a strange situation with the tests vs validators due to an error in my code when I got this in a clash.\n\nI tested the IPs using the following Ruby code for validity:\nip[/^(\\d+\\.){3}\\d+$/] && ip.split.map(&:to_i).all?{_1<256}\n\nThe error was I forgot to write \".split(\".\")\" instead of \".split\", so I effectively only checked that the first byte was less than 256 and that it had 4 parts.\n\nThis was actually enough to pass all the test cases (100%), but then I got 33% on the validators once I submitted.\n\nSo it would be good to perhaps swap Test 1 and Validator 1 for example, to make sure that the tests and validators are able to both test for such issues. :)",
