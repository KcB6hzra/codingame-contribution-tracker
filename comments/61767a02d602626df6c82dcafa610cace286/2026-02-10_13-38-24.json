That's just an uninteresting extra layer of complication for no reason.",

    "content": "Well, I don't go around checking the lengths of the solutions for all shortest mode clashes. I checked because it didn't seem very appropriate for shortest mode to me. Extensive string parsing and output formatting, for instance. Different types of input characters treated differently, requiring explicit conditions.\nI don't expect the solution to be \"exclusively\" for shortest mode; but it does seem to me that most contributors simply check shortest mode without giving any thought to what it actually entails. I think shortest mode puzzles that can't be made short are simply not as good as ones that can. There are hundreds of them on CG, so IMO Shortest mode puzzles should be specifically made to be interesting in Shortest mode.",

In my previous solution I had a mistake where, when I take a word and make it into a sorted list of characters (so that I could get their indexes afterwards), I forgot to remove the doubled characters, so the characters that came after them ended up having indexes bigger than they were supposed to (so the 's' in 'bullshit' got 6 instead of 5 because of the 'll' and so on):\n\n```\ns = input()\n\nanswer = []\nfor word in s.lower().split():\n    sorted_letters = sorted([c for c in word if c.isalpha()])\n    new_word = ''\n    for char in word:\n        new_word += (char if not char.isalpha()\n                    else str(sorted_letters.index(char) + 1))\n    answer += [new_word]\nprint(*answer)\n```\n\nSo I just had to feed it to a set right before I sorted it, just like you did:\n\n```\nsorted_letters = sorted(set([c for c in word if c.isalpha()]))\n```\n\nSo it should be OK now, I really appreciate your feedback and testing, it was very helpful! Thanks a lot.\n\nAnd I've removed Reverse mode since I've realized that like you said, the clash is hard enough for Fastest/Shortest modes.",
