I just tested the clash in IDE and ran into another problem: the Goal statement says the south west corner is 10 0, but the constrains say y<=9. I take it the \"10\" in the Goal statement should be changed to \"9\"?\n\nApart from that, I was able to solve it in a reasonable time, and it's a good clash IMO. I also like your reference solution, that's some pretty clever use of booleans and the \"*\" operator! I learned a new trick :)",

By looking at your code, I'm even more confused, since you change the X coordinate for north and south, and the Y coordinate for west and east.\n\nThe Y coordinate is usually used for north and south, and the X coordinate is usually used for west and east. Nothing in the clash gives any information about this. Is this a confusion on your part, or a bad assumption on my part? I don't understand how we've arrived to this situation.",

I thought about it when writing and the first coordinate in a matrix is often the vertical axis and north south is often associated to vetical.\nEven in geographic coordinates is (latitude, longitude) which is basically (north/south, est/west).\nSo I think my convention is clearer for a majority. But it is interesting to see how different people approach a problem.\nMaybe I could change variable name to lat long instead of x y but those being angles and not distances I don't think I would be clearer.\nAnyway I changed \"The north west corner is 0 0.\" To \"The north west corner is 0 0 and the south west is 10 0\" to disambiguate.\nThank you for your feedback tho",
