    "content": "So far I haven't actually changed any test cases, but I noticed that (what is now) the last test case is the only one where:\n* The where clause compares numerical instead of string values.\n* The order by clause orders by string instead of numeric values.\n* The order by clause orders by a column that is not selected.\n\nIdeally these would all be included, but they're not covered in the validators. Worse, the sort order in this test is ineffective as there's only a single row to output. It's too late to fix this by extending the tests and validators. Therefore, I would like to change the last test case to more closely mirror its validator. This will only simplify the problem. In particular, I'd like to use:\n\nSELECT Rooms, Regionname FROM Housing WHERE Suburb = HeidelbergHeights ORDER BY Rooms DESC",

I mean, yeah, that's covered in only one pair of cases, but actually it's good that it enforces the need to check carefully to determine whether a column is of the variable type of number or string, beyond just checking the first character of the value of a field.\n\nIn Python, it's just:\n\ntry:\n    field = float(field)\n    # now we know the field is of the number type\nexcept:\n    pass\n    # now we know the field is of the string type\n\nSo, I'd rather those cases be restored.",
