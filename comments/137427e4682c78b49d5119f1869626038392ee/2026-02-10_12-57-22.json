    "content": "Very entertaining. Not completed yet, but my assumption is that the single play of the base position is based on heuristics (e.g. play a win if possible,  avoid a loose if required,  play a move that allow more possible wins, etc...).  Can you please clarify in the narrative if it's the case or if some minmax is required ?  \nAlso, validator 6 and 9  fail whereas the corresponding test case works.  This situation is usually quite frustrating.  Is it possible to think of a test case that is less probable to be green when the validator is red ?",

    "content": "Hey @Chris27, thank you for the comment.\n\nRegarding your first question, I've specified in the problem statement that the engine should always play the best possible move: \"On its turn, the engine must choose the move that maximizes its chance of winning, or forces a draw, or delays a loss. In a winning position, the engine should choose the move that wins in the fewest number of turns. Likewise, in a losing position, the engine should choose the move that loses in the most number of turns.\" It is up to you to choose a heuristic-based or minmax-based method, or any other method, to solve the problem.\n\nRegarding Validators 6 and 9, I don't see why these validators should fail. For Validator 6, there are only two winning moves (either top-right or bottom-left corner), and their cell values acts as the tie-breaker. Similarly, for Validator 9, both valid moves lose, but their cell values ultimately lead you to choose the top-right corner. The puzzle has been set up this way to ensure a deterministic output.",

Consider adding a clarification to the end:\n\nIf the game is already over, output the board unchanged.\n\nDifficulty\n* I would classify this puzzle as Medium. For comparison,\n  • Easy: Involves loops, conditions and basic string manipulation.\n  • Medium: Involves algorithms such as BFS, DFS and recursion.\n  • This puzzle: Implementing Minimax is more complex than any of the above, though it doesn't quite reach the Hard level.\n\nCases\n* Validator 9 violates the constraint.\n\n* Consider splitting pair 10 into two separate pairs:\n  • One where [[engine]] is \"O\", and the first X can be placed anywhere on the board.\n  • Another where [[engine]] is \"X\" and the board is empty (and test = validator).\n\nThanks.",
