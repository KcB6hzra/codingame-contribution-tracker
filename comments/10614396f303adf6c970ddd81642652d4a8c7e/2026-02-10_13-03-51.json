    "content": "This clash is extremely hard to read in-clash.\nIt was really hard to understand some of the wording, for me.\n\nI think it would really help to explain how to get the example answer of 52.\nlength = 4, width = 4, height = 4.\nSo you could explain that the floor is 16 blocks + 16 blocks for the ceiling, then all the walls need 2 blocks of height which gives 2*(4+4+2+2) = 24, so total of 56, but then -4 for the door = 52.\n\nWithout some sort of explanation it's very hard to understand what's happening in the tests.\nIt's hard to know whether the height should include the floor, or whether the floor is below ground (i.e. h=4 could mean that there are actually 5 blocks of height, but the floor isn't counted, meaning the walls are all 3 blocks high, with 1 block for the floor and ceiling).\nAlso, the part about the 4 blocks being removed for the door is very confusing at first, because it's really 2x2 blocks, since it's always 2 wide.\n\nIt's a very hard clash to understand, then solving it also takes time... I definitely didn't finish it in 5 minutes, and I'm surprised anyone can. Fastest in my clash was about 6 minutes, I took 12 minutes.",

    "content": "I don't understand a couple of things:\n- 4 blocks are removed for the door. Is this 4 vertical (i.e. per _ 4 blocks are gone), or 4 total (i.e. in case one I see two _, so I can assume the door is two high)?\n- What do you mean with 'Every type of block is used for the box of the house, except ...' I only see one type of block, but 'every type of block' suggests there are multiple block  types.\n- In the output, 'This includes the floor and the ceiling': should I assume that exactly the same blocks are used for the walls and the ceiling? Is the blueprint a flat representation of the floor, or does the floor come under that (is the floor always fully closed with size bl * bw, or do characters not being # of the blueprint go out of the floor?\n- You write '... except stairs and doors.' Doors are given a character, what about stairs?\n- You write 'you have to find the length and width of the box' - are length and width not given by you?",
