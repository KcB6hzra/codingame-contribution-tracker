Looking through the types of problems in the standard set of Easy and Medium puzzles, I'd say that this falls pretty squarely in the range of \"hardest easy\" to \"easiest medium\". While a bit easy for my taste as well, it is within the range of acceptable difficulty for a community puzzle. I am going to go ahead and accept it.",
