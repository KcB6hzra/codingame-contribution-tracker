    "content": "This is terrible for reverse mode, I'm suprised it got such high approval.\n\nI just managed to solve it with 100% on tests, but then only got 80% on validators...\n\nThe problem was Validator 3 is the only case where the rhyming part is purely composed of vowels. Also how the hell is a clash of code answer meant to recognise that \"prest\" rhymes with \"breast\", they don't have the same vowels, which makes it a hard problem to solve, especially when hidden in validators...\n\nValidator 3 should be made much simpler at the least, but really this clash needs a statement and shouldn't be in reverse mode, imo...\n\nIn the end, it seems all you need to check to get 100% are the last two letter of each line, which is not intuitive and is quite hacky. You can't expect people to guess such a specific and arbitrary rule in reverse mode...",
