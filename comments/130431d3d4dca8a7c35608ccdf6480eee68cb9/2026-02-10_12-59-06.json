So, all you need to do is divide the perimeter by 4 and multiply that by double of itself. But in my opinion, I don't believe what Chromothous says. I think it's a very decent puzzle overall. Approved!",

    "content": "A great clash that involves a little bit of maths! \n\nHowever, I have encountered a slight issue. In Test 2 and Validator 2, Python's round function rounds the number 1891.125 to 1891.12. \n\nMy approach to solving this clash involves calculus (optimisation): \n\nLet l and w be the length and width of the land, and n be the length of the fencing available. \n\n2l + w = n     --- (1) \n\nWe also know that area (A) can be calculated as: \n\nA = l * w     --- (2) \n\nRearranging equation (1) gives me: \n\nw = n - 2l   --- (3) \n\nSubstitute equation (3) to (2): \n\nA = l * (n - 2l) \nA = n * l - 2 * l ^ 2\n\nTake the derivative of A: \n\nA' = n - 4l \n\nMaximum area occurs when A' = 0, so l = n / 4. \n\nSubstitute l = n / 4 in equation (3): \n\nw = n - 2 * (n / 4)\nw = n - n / 2\n\nThis gives us the maximum area formula A_max: \nA_max = n / 4 * (n - n / 2).",

It’s a clever way to avoid complex algebra, and I appreciate the simplicity it brings.\n\nHowever, Clash of Code rounds are designed for quick problem-solving. While this approach works, the fine-grained loop and floating-point steps could lead to slower execution and a heavier coding burden than typical challenges in the arena.\n\nBecause of that, I still feel this problem might be better suited for formats allowing less pressure in the moment.\n\nI truly value your contribution and hope this feedback helps guide future submissions toward the best fit for Clash of Code’s pace and style.\n\nThanks again for your effort!",
