Also, the \"you can safely assume that\" isn't necessary, I think it's obvious by the test case and it is only needed when you have another rule to say.\n\nFinally, please remove the [[*]], this should only be used for variable names.\n\nEDIT: also, could you add some lore to make it funnier? Like it's Link who need to go to rescue Zelda?\nI was just thinking that instead of having Line1 and Line2 as coordinate, you could use two other symbol, like \"L\" and \"Z\" for target and destination, could be more visual",
