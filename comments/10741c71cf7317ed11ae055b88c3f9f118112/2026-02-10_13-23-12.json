    "content": "Note: please take the below with the tone of \"intended to help you improve\" and not as an attack.\n\nI don't understand many aspects of this puzzle.\n\nLet's start with the obvious, Test 1, same as example. Test data is:\nHello world\n4\n0|11|!\n0|5|,\\n\n0|7| w\n0|10|\\n\n\nAfter first step the string becomes:\nHello world!\n\nAfter second step it becomes a two line string (or whatever that is):\nHello,\n world!\n\nwhere the second line starts with a space.\nThird command is to make a change at row index 0, column index 7. First line is of length 6, so not even with 1-based indexing would this work. If \"\\n\" should be replaced only after last step, then row index in the input makes no sense at all. If \"\\n\" would represent a single character and thus the first line is of length 7, then adding something AFTER it is impossible since that would contradict what EOL (end of line) represents. This most certainly means that the new characters won't land at the beginning of the second line, since that is the 1|0 command. Also please note that not a single software in existence let's you write something after the end of line character.\n\nFurthermore, \"rawChange = {Line number (int)}|{Column number (int)}|{String to add at the position (string)}\" is not a constraint, that's exactly what the input is for. So I suggest to rephrase \"Next changeCount lines:\" to be \"A string of the format rowIndex|columnIndex|addendum\", where ...\", you explain all 3 variables (make it yellow). Also the pipe symbol should be blue as that is a fix separator. If you don't like it like this you can specify the 3 variable names and say \"that are separated by |\". If you look at a few tens of CG made puzzles you will see many examples of both formatting.\n\nThe Output section should be something along the lines of \"the string after making all changes\". Manipulation is a strong word to use for adding a few characters to a string.\n\nFor the constraint \"s String of length ≥ 1\", that's sort of a given, the goal is to have a maximum value, so more like \"length of s <= 7\", where  7 is an actual number based on tests and validators (I'm lazy to count).\n\nAs a bonus, as a software engineer you should always avoid one character variable names, so if you can find a better fitting name than \"s\" it would be awesome.\n\nThe description part should be much more descriptive. Always specify that you are using 0-based indexing. Specify that the \"\\n\" string represents a special character. Specify if that should be replaced immediately.\n\nThe current version of this puzzle is more a reverse engineering puzzle than a \"normal\" one, which is not the goal of puzzles in this section.\n\nAnd lastly the tag \"Strive for Simplicity\" is incorrect. There is literally no way to make the solution simpler or more complicated, the runtime difference of solutions in the same language should be in the range of nanoseconds I guess.",

This would be how edits to a document work... and it's what most people will expect.\n\nInstead, we have a strange situation where :\n1. newlines are added, and converted, but are ignored\n2. pre-existing newlines are respected\nso...\n3. Number of lines is fixed until output converts newlines\n\nThe description does not adequately convey this, IMO.",
