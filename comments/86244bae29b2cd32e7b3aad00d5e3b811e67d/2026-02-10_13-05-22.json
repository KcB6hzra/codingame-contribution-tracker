I found the rounding a pain in python and my solution was kludged to work since .499999999 isn't .50000000.  Anyway, that's Python for you and doesn't reflect the puzzle.  It was pretty straight forward.  The reason it took me so long was because I didn't actually feel like thinking about time zones or rounding and just treated the puzzle as a reverse.",
