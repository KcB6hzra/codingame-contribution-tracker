Over the last 9+ months, I developed an Algorithm X Solver and I worked several of the puzzles @5DN1L had identified as Algorithm X candidates. My Algorithm X Solver did the job, but it was sometimes a bit slow and I always thought I would someday need to swap out my \"relatively\" slow engine for the supposedly super fast DLX. Well, this puzzle forced my hand.\n\nSudoku is well understood. In this puzzle, the grid is just bigger. The author has done a great job with the test cases. I don't mean to put words in the author's mouth, but I get the feeling the author is suggesting we all learn DLX. Looking back over the last few days, I'm certainly glad I did.",

    "content": "For other reviewers, I'd like to know how easily you can convert your solution for the original Sudoku Solver to solve this proposed 25x25 puzzle:\n\nhttps://www.codingame.com/training/medium/sudoku-solver\n\nI spent last fall developing a non-DLX Algorithm X solver. I just took my code from Sudoku Solver and I replaced all my 9s with 25 and all my 3s with 5. I converted the input grid to numbers between 0 and 24 instead of letters so I would hopefully not have to change any other code. Overall, this all took me about 10 minutes, mostly because I had to hunt for my most recent Algorithm X Solver version.\n\nMy Algorithm X solver (Python) is nowhere near as fast as DLX and my slowest time on any test case here is about 160 ms.\n\nI'm not against this puzzle being approved. However, I want to see what other reviewers have to say. Two things could have just happened.\n\n1) Maybe I just demonstrated how powerful a reusable Algorithm X framework can be.\n\n2) Maybe it's really easy to take Sudoku Solver code and modify it for this puzzle.\n\nHere's another thought. Might you want the grids to be a bit more sparse? I fully expected my slowish Python Algorithm X Solver to take several seconds instead of 160 ms.",

    "content": "It looks like you made test 5 and validator 5 significantly harder. I can solve the first 4 test cases and the first 4 validators with only logic, no backtracking at all. For test case 5, I believe there are still 253 unknown cells after all logic is initially applied. That is a really big jump all at once.\n\nI am using traditional backtracking in combination with a bunch of logic and I am very close to success on test case 5 and validator 5. My Algorithm X implementation is way too slow.\n\nI think you might have to adjust the test cases a bit more depending on what you want for your puzzle. Right now there is a giant leap from the first 4 test cases to the last. If you want to finish with a test case as tough as case 5, you might want to see if you can get the test cases to smooth out the journey from test case 1 to test case 5, maybe by making 3 and 4 a bit more difficult.\n\nI get it that jumping straight to DLX is probably the best way to go, but do you want the non-DLX puzzler to have a reasonable chance of success? If you do, I'm not against you making test 5 a bit closer to the rest of the cases. If you're looking for primarily DLX solutions, that is fine too.\n\nI'm also not against you going back to the original test 5 and validator 5. I ended up testing 8 random solutions from Sudoku Solver and only 1 of the 8 could pass test cases 1 to 4, so there is obviously a challenge there.\n\nI apologize for being wishy-washy about this. There are some pretty interesting design choices to think about with your test cases depending on the audience you hope to engage. Because your solution is DLX, I'm sure it flies through everything, but a lot of non DLXers might attempt your puzzle.",

All I did was flip my Matrix A vertically and horizontally. Algorithm X has a couple of non-deterministic steps and these flips affect both of those steps. The steps are:\n\n1) When choosing a column, how are ties broken? You and I are both breaking ties simply by going left to right in Matrix A.\n\n2) When more than one row will cover the chosen column, you and I are both simply going from top to bottom in Matrix A.\n\nIf you have some reason for why you chose that particular orientation of Matrix A, I'd like to hear it. This is not something I've run into with Algorithm X before. I can easily change my orientation now since I have the code written both ways. In the future, I guess this is a technique I try.\n\nStill, I'd hate to be the the Codingamer that wrote a great DLX implementation, but drove himself or herself crazy all due to the wrong Matrix A orientation. Maybe this is a known technique with Algorithm X that I just don't know about. Did you run into this issue?",

The way things are today, this puzzle is way harder than your original submission. I am ready to approve. I just want to make sure this is what you want. There are things to be learned from both versions, and each version really would have a different audience.\n\nWhat about two identical puzzles, a part one and part two? Obviously, the test cases would be different, but other than that, just a short explanation as to why there is part I and part II. If you were to do that, test case five should be a little easier on part one so that it also could be solved with just logic like the original four test cases were. Part II would be today’s version that almost certainly will require DLX.\n\nPart I would only be medium. Part II would definitely be hard. And you get credit for two puzzles!",

We could easily create a 16x16 grid that would be much more difficult to solve than a 36x36 grid. I believe grid composition has a larger role in difficulty than size.\n\nWhatever you decide, if you submit a medium version of this puzzle, I would give it a rave review as long as it truly targets the medium puzzler by emphasizing:\n\n1) Traditional backtracking alone will not be enough.\n2) Using logic to make your backtracking more efficient is the key.\n3) In fact, each of these grids can be solved 100% with logic if you choose to go that route.\n4) Algorithm X / DLX can be used to solve these grids, but they are definitely not necessary.\n\nAlso, if you create a medium version of this puzzle, I think you should publish a non DLX, non Algorithm X solution. In my mind, the purpose of a medium version of the puzzle is to engage the puzzler in the concept of using logic to increase backtracking efficiency. As you mentioned above, designing the puzzle to almost certainly require DLX makes it hard, if not expert.\n\nOne last comment on a medium version of this puzzle. Just my opinion, but I believe a bunch of the authors of the Sudoku solutions I tried to retrofit would do the medium version, but many less will do this hard version. To me, that justifies having both versions.",

Our goal is to create a Sudoku puzzle that is truly between the relatively easy level of the original Sudoku Solver and the very difficult level of this 25x25. Your opinion on how well we met or did not meet that goal would also be valuable and much appreciated!",

    "content": "@Timinator Thank you for inviting me to review this puzzle. Actually I solved it soon after it was first published and I didn't see any issue with it, so I didn't leave any comment.\n\nI think the difficulty is appropriate there. A player who solved a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle can adopt their code to solve the 16x16 puzzle relatively easily, and that also paves the way for solving this 25x25 challenge.\n\nOne thing just pops to my mind though. Have you checked whether each case indeed has no more than one solution? I haven't further improved my slow 25x25 Sudoku solver since last time, so it'll be too slow for my solver to check that :P (I'm sorry if you've checked, mentioned it before and I've missed it.)",

    "content": "With a bare minimum of logical deductions to reduce the initial search space, the times taken to solve using my Algorithm X solver (Python) locally on my laptop were as follows (the performance was quite wild):\n\nTest 1: 0.02 s\nValidator 1: 0.01 s\nTest 2: 48 s\nValidator 2: 13 s (0.96 s*)\nTest 3: 6 s\nValidator 3: 105 s\nTest 4: 80 s (52 s*)\nValidator 4: 4 s (1.38 s*)\nTest 5: 4999 s (!) (1870 s*)\nValidator 5: 44 s\n\n* My \"Algorithm X with secondary columns\" solver worked better here.\n\nI haven't done a lot of modifications to get the above results, but it does seem to show that it is not straight-forward to convert previous solutions to fit this puzzle. Maybe coders using faster languages have a different conclusion.\n\nMy previous experience in solving the harder CG puzzles with my said solver is that it can handle them but only if I have reduced the initial search space a lot first. I guess I may be able to do the same thing with this 25x25 Sudoku puzzle without switching to DLX or another approach, but I'm not sure.",
