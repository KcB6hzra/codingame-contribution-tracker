The problem is not too complex, but the player will still be able to think about it enough for it to serve the purpose. It should be solvable in less than 5 minutes for most players, as the solution is quite simple. Overall, I think this is a great problem to be implemented into Clash of Code.",

    "content": "Thanks for your honesty. While creating this puzzle I already suspected it might be better as an Easy In/Out Puzzle, but for a Classic Puzzle I prefer to make it as complete as possible and implement a variety of edge cases. I was too lazy for that so I chose the Clash format for now.\n\nIn all honesty, I am not sure how much time it would take me if I would encounter this clash as player. Once I had the realization that it works to iteratively find the first 1, check whether that one belongs to a bus or car or bicycle, turn the corresponding size into zeros and do that all over again, it kind of felt to be possible within the time-range of 5-15 minutes. But coming to that realization itself can probably take (quite) some time, and possibly some players accidentally fall into much more complex and time-intensive approaches.\n\nExcept if I soon get some very positive remarks, I will not keep it in this format. Maybe I will downsize it to only cars and bicycles (what do you think, would that bring it properly within Clash size?), and/or take my time to make a Classic Puzzle after all. Maybe one with also a bus/car accident\n1001\n0110\n0000\n0110\n1001\nor a tricycle\n010\n101\n.",

    "content": "Oops 😬 sorry. There has been some doubt on the difficulty (see below comments).\n\nI'm a fan of numpy arrays; in a 2d array I iteratively find the first leftmost tire, check from there whether there is tire below (cycle), or to the right (car) and otherwise it must be bus, and then turn the corresponding area into zeros and go to the next iteration. Personally I think that's much easier than regex (but I'm bad at regex anyway), and this approach is rather easy to implement in five minutes. However, the problem might be in coming up with this approach in time - or maybe I think too easy of my approach.",
