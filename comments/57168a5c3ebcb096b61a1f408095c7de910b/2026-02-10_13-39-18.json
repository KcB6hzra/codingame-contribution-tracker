It's extremely crucial for shortest mode since you are leaving players guessing if you included other non-alpha characters in the validators or if your statement is wrong.\nThat's very bad. It may not seem so crucial at first glance but it is. \n\n- Gilad-Gur-Andelman pointed out that variable names do not make sense. I'll expand on that:\nGiven string in the Statement is called \"S\", in the input it's \"n\".\nIn the statement the name of the string \"S\" is not decorated, chars \"A\" and \"B\" are not decorated as cell, nowhere is specified that A and B are not strings.\nVariable \"a\" is referred to only in the output and nowhere else.\n\n- dowe pointed out that stub doesn't match Constrains.\nAlso, you need to use \"≤\" instead of \"<\"  in the constraints.\nAnd you need to put dots at the ends of the sentences in the Statement.\n\n\nPlease, do not approve until those points are fixed. As it is the puzzle is simply doesn't work in Fastest and Shortest.",

    "content": "Nice clash you created there.\nI have some comments:\n\n1. as @eclep wrote, the goal statement can be clearer. Suggestion:\n\"Print the total sum of alphabet position (zero-based index) all the characters in the given string S\". And give as an example \"A's index is 0 and B's index is 1\".\n\n2. The input string should be named 'S' or 's', because 'n' is usually reserved for lengths variables.\nI suggest defining the input like this:\nInput\n1 Line: S, A string of length n.\n\n3. The output has a typo. It should be:\nOutput\n1 Line: An integer a\n\n4. In the Constraints section, you use 'len(n)'. This is clear to those who know Python, but not all code in Python and will understand right away... This will give an unfair advantage to Python players. Instead, I suggest:\nConstraints\n1 < n < 256\n(remember we defined n in the Input section already)\n\n5. Why only uppercase?\nGive the users a mixed string of upper and lowercase to add some (not much though) complexity and challenge.\nStill, this should apply a=A=0, b=B=1, etc.\n\nAgain, nice work and good luck :)",
