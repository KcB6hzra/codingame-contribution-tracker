    "content": "This is not a clearly written problem without the ability to see the output for the complex examples. The first example is too simple for you to really see what you're asking when x != y. Then trying to debug those ones is a nightmare because you're debugging it line-by-line.\n\nI just won this with a 33% attempt in a clash.\n\nIt really needs a lot more clarification.\n\nIt's not clear that you're meant to write empty lines if the  y value is larger than the x value, for example. Especially since you specifically say \"Don't print any more lines or spaces than are necessary.\", which could be taken to mean 'don't write any blank lines, just draw the x'.\n\nI think this challenge is nice, but ironically I think it would only really work in Reverse mode (where you can see exactly what you're asking us to do), but it's currently only active for Shortest and Fastest modes.",

    "content": "Hi Stepback—\n\nThanks for the feedback but at this point it’s kinda out of my hands.  \n\nI submitted the puzzle but then 3 other people vetted/approved it as written.\nTherefore it wouldn’t be right to change things after they approved it the way it was.  (They might not consider a change to be an improvement)\n\nThe very first Clash I ever wrote that was approved (which looking back really wasn’t very good) got removed a few months later because it had not received enough good ratings/feedback (some phrasing like that).\n\nSo Codingame does have a mechanism to remove “bad” clashes.  When you play a clash you find unworthy, be sure to fill out the rating at the end.  That mechanism does remove (over time) Clashes that the community deems bad enough.\n\nIt hurts my heart to know that my puzzle is frustrating instead of fun and educational.  But I do appreciate your insight as it will be in-mind as I create future ones.",
