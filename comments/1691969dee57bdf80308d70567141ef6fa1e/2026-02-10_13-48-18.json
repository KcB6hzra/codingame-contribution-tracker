It's power (kW) that makes fuse blown and not consumption... ok, ok, it makes no changes about how pretty solving your puzzle was ;-)",

One should differentiate between them, they are not the same physical quantities. For example, the 1A electrical current through the equipment that is plugged to mains socket in US will produce only about half the power, when comparing to the same 1A in EU mains socket.",

    "content": "Thanks your constructive comment. There was an opposite argument saying that power is in W or kW while the fuse capacity is in A so that it does not make sense to directly compare the two.\nI am assuming power consumption values of devices have been converted into the same unit A (formula varies according to local power supply standard) to allow for comparison and calculation. So comes the term \"current consumption\" instead of \"power consumption\".\nI'm no expert in electricity or physics. I thought about alternative terms like \"loading\", but not quite sure the proper usage.\nBut anyway \"consumed current\" was a term included in the output. This one cannot be changed. All other descriptions can be amended for good reasons.",

For simplicity here assumes the power consumption of electrical devices is translated into the same unit for current.
