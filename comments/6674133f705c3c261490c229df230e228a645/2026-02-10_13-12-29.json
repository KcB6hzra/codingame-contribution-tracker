    "content": "Thank you. I would suggest to modify Test/Validator 8 further by throwing in a few more pairs of chromosomes where Mother = Child using just one single character, e.g. Mother is 11 and Child is 11, and for some of such pairs all possible Fathers contain 1, while for other pairs one or more do not contain 1.\n\nBy the way, I tried Validator 8 by reading the chromosomes starting from the right instead of the left, and it just took me 2 \"moves\" to narrow down to Orlando 😂",
