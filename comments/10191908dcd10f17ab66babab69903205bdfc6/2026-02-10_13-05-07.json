There's lots of palindrome clashes, but this one adds some original and meaningful complexity in the Strong/Weak distinction.\n\nOnly edit I'd make is \"A palindrome is a word, number, or sequence\" -> \"or string\". Sequence seems like the wrong word to describe it, could say 'sentence' or 'string' and it would be more clear.",

    "content": "Binary output issue\n* According to the contribution guidelines, binary output should be avoided for clashes. As your clash accepts only two possible answers (either \"true\" or \"false\"), it suffers from the binary output issue. Please change the output requirement so that there are more than two possible answers in total.\n\nGoal\n* Please change \"nonword\" to \"non-alphanumerical\".\n\nOutput\n* Please format \"true\" and \"false\" as {{constants}} instead of [[variables]].\n\n* Please delete \"indeed\".\n\nCases\n* Please revise Test 5 so that it's more similar to Validator 5.\n\nThanks.",
