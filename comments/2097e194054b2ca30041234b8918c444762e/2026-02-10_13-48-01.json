I first computed it by multiplying by 3 every even position in my result array, keeping every odd position the same, and then had to check an example on an external ressource to realize the correct procedure is the exact opposite. Maybe add an example?\nThe \"INVALID SCAN\" string should appear in the I/O section (and can probably be ommited in the description).",

So, there might not be enough characters left to properly align the tables :(\nAnyway it would be good to know how to do such alignment for the future.",
