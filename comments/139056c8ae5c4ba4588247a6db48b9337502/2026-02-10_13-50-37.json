    "content": "So basically this puzzle has the same test cases and validators as the Enhanced edition? That'll be duplication. (This is different from the Ultimate edition where although the cases are the same the output requirement is different.)\n\nI understand the intention may be to let players solve this one first and later find that the written code is unable to solve the harder one, but still...\n\nAlso, as this puzzle hasn't been published yet, the Enhanced edition puzzle statement should not include a reference to this puzzle yet.",

    "content": "As i explained in the other comment, at the time the puzzles were approved out of order, which led to the clunky situation we have now.\n\nOf course the tests are the same! In the grand scheme, this one is a superset of extreme, enhanced is a superset of this one, and impossible (still in draft) is a superset of enhanced.\n\nPlease abstract away from the order of publication if you can't temporarily forget the smart way to solve it. This one admits simpler solutions, and is targeted at a much more beginner audience, in an explicitly easy section, now it exists.\n\n(You solved enhanced. You're no beginner ;-)",
