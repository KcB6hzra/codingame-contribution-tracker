Even without knowing what a fibonaci, the context clues describe it w/o having to google thanks to the way it's worded.\n\n100% solvable in 5mins.\n\n'Incorrect Input' adds a little twist that makes clashers panic code in a solution if it's negative and do some testing, in the event they glossed over the \"Output\" section, as I naively did when trying to speed code a solution",

    "content": "Goal\n* Please change \"serie\" to \"series\" (the singular and plural forms are the same: \"series\").\n\n* Please delete \"eg:\". You can define a Tribonacci series in different ways by specifying different starting numbers. As you restrict the players to use the same starting numbers as yours, it is NOT an example.\n\n* Please mention when \"Incorrect input\" should be output. Do remember to format \"Incorrect input\" as a {{constant}} in the explanation.\n\nInput\n* Please format \"N\" as a [[variable]] (i.e. change \"N\" to \"[[N]]\").\n\nOutput\n* Please format \"N\" as a [[variable]].\n\n* Please add \"or {{Incorrect input}}\".\n\nConstraints\n* Please format \"N\" as a [[variable]].\n\nCases\n* Each pair of test and validator should be similar (e.g. in terms of magnitude of input or type of answer) but different. Please revise the cases so that there are no duplicate.\n\n* Please avoid requiring an output greater than 2**64 because not all programming languages available on CodinGame are able handle arbitrarily large numbers.\n\nThanks.",
