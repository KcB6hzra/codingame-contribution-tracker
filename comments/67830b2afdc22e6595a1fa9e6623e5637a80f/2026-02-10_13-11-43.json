Take care to remove all three pairs of brackets.\n\n* Important note 1: Please put the example after \"separate word\".\n\n* Please fix the typo: \"its\" => \"it is\".\n\n* Please format all the greetings and example texts as {{constants}} in the three important notes.\n\n* Important note 3: Tests 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 don't follow the order mentioned in the note. In fact, the order is reversed.\n\nThanks again.",
