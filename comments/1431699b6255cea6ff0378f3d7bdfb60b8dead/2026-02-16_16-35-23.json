    "content": "Agreed with 5DN1L, probably too easy for a classical puzzle (but the goal is probably too long for a CoC as well?). Anyway, your test 9 is a duplicate and should be removed. Moreover, you should add a pair of tests with a large numer, e.g 13, and another one with a multiple of 9, e.g. 18.",

You may re-create it as a clash of code instead.\n\nFormatting\n* Please study the formatting syntax on this page: https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/statement , and format your statement properly as described in the points below.\n\nGoal\n* Please format \"N\" as a [[variable]].\n\nInput\n* Please format \"N as a [[variable]].\n\n* Please delete \"(1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9)\".\n\nOutput\n* Please delete \"Contraintes\".\n\nConstraints\n* Please format \"N\" as a [[variable]].\n\n* Please change 10^9 to 100.\n\nStub generator\n* Please add a write statement, e.g. write answer.\n\nCases\n* Each test and its validator should cover the same scenario with slightly different inputs and outputs. Please revise all the validators accordingly.\n\n* Please reduce the number of case pairs that use a 1-digit integer as input, and include more case pairs that use a 2-digit integer as input.\n\nThanks.",
