It took around 7 ms to solve the last pair of test and validator.\n\nIt does seem that grids of greater sizes are doable within the CG time limit. Now it depends on the author to decide whether to include such grids in the test cases or not. After all, some puzzles are created with the intention to cover aspects other than optimisation.\n\nAlso, I have no idea what the exact CG time limit is. I would consider 1 second* as an appropriate soft limit in setting the test cases with the aim of minimising the chances that it becomes impossible to solve a puzzle using slower programming languages.\n\n* (in Python probably, as it is one of the most popular language used here?)",
