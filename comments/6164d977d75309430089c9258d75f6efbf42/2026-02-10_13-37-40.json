If there's a limitation on CG side, then maybe its worth mentioning that you have to combine it or carry over checks between chunks in the description. \nOtherwise its quite fun puzzle.",

    "content": "Hi there, I enjoyed this problem.  \n\nQuick question: for test 2, why is the pair \"ff\" replaced with W, as it seems there is only one non-overlapping pair.\n\nMy output:\nFailure\nFound: aeXfffbdXacZd...\nExpected: aeXWfbdXacZd\n\nMaybe I am a little confused from the problem statement, but my take is:\n\nFrom step 1, it says \"note: we only count (and replace) non-overlapping repetitions.\"  Further, \"each iteration reduces the length of the string by at least 2\" so we should have a minimum of two replacements.  Here, only one \"W\" is in the output.  \"There are now no repeated byte pairs, so the algorithm terminates.\"",
