    "content": "Could someone explain the statement to me? I had this clash, and I saw that the instructions to solve it were included in the statement, but I didn't like that. I wanted to understand exactly what these sequences are.\nYou say they are generated from the polynomial x**n, and I must find n given 15 numbers from the sequence, aka the degree of the sequence. This explanation fits perfectly for all of the examples until the one you call \"Tricky\". Yes, it's tricky, because I cannot see how it matches the description. I could have simply applied the given formula, but that doesn't seem like the best way to approach challenges.\nWith the sequence:\n1 1 2 4 7 11 16 22 29 37 46 56 67 79 92\nAnd the expected answer 2, what the statement tells me is that each of these numbers is some x raised to the 2nd power, and the sequence can start \"from any integer bigger than 0\".\nI see how the formula you give for solving leads to this, and even without it, I would have noticed that the differences between successive terms increase by 1. But I do not see how these numbers are x**2 for any sequence of numbers. They are not even x**2 for any set of integers.\nMy first reaction would be to say that this first part of the statement is misleading, but I wanted to ask. I seem to be the first person to have trouble with this.\nBut again, if the statement isn't clear, I don't think simply providing a formula for solving the problem in the statement makes it better.",
