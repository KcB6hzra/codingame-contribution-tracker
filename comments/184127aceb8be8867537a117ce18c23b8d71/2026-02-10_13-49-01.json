It has to be interesting. \nI felt it interesting at the first glance because it could be an opportunity to try dynamic comparator for sorting (sorting string and number in different columns, on demand, in different test cases).

    "content": "Have a remaining problem. Now coders have to guess what datatype it is in each column. It can be a string or a number. (Is there a third type, like a datetime?) Sorting a string is by alphanumeric ordering; sorting a number is by the value in the number. If you do not explicitly tell coders what datatype it is, the guessing can be wrong. For example, a column full of [0..9] looks like a number sorting, but it can also be a string or date sorting. Who knows?\nYou need to provide the data type, possibly by adding a line below your Line1:\n\n+age-name\nnumber,string",
