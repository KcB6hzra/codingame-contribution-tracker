    "content": "Nice game. The time limitation will make this quite interesting. The downloadable PGN is a nice touch.\n\nMaybe this is just my laziness speaking, but it might be nice if instead of instantly losing upon making an invalid move it just fell back to making a random move. I've seen other games on CG do this, so it's not without precedence. That would help lower the bar for new players so you can see progress without having to implement the more complicated rules first. As it is now you can't even win against the random bot until you spend a decent amount of time building out the rules.\n\nThanks.",

I see this less as an actual competition and more as an opportunity to experiment and apply all kinds of classical (and modern?) AI theory. However, the extreme constraints of 50 ms on a single-core have also not been well studied IMO, so it could breed some interesting competition on that.\n\nFor me the competition would have been more on the crazyhouse variant, but it seems rather unpopular so I'll probably only publish the chess960 variant.\n\nGood point about linking to the chessprogramming wiki, will add that to the statement. I disagree with the UCI part, as it treats of all kinds of aspects that are irrelevant to this submission, the only relevance is in the move encoding.",
