    "content": "I've edited the statement based on the comment in the forum ( https://forum.codingame.com/t/community-puzzle-self-driving-car-testing/2275/19 ). The following are the details of the main changes.\n\nGoal\n* Changed:\nOn an ASCII vertical scrolling, you display the car on each portion of the road.\nto:\nOn an ASCII road, you display the car moving from the top to the bottom.\n\n* Added:\nFor each step, the car moves down one line. At the same time, it shifts one column to the left for {{L}}, one column to the right for {{R}}, or stays in the same column for {{S}}.\n\nChanged:\nahead, then three times to the right\nto:\nahead (down), then three times down and right\n\nAdded:\nIf the car's position coincides with a road character, display only the car (#) in that position.\n\nInput\n* Changed:\nLine 2: The position X (starting from 1) of the car at the beginning, then a list of command separated by a semi-colon ;\nto:\nLine 2: The column position (1-based index) of the car at the beginning, then a list of commands, all separated by a semi-colon ;\n\nConstraints\n* Added:\n1 ≤ [[N]] ≤ 20\nOutput: 1 ≤ number of lines, length of each line ≤ 40\n\nCases\n* Revised \"Gentleman, start your engines\" (Validator 2) to have one less line in both the input and the output because the validator was originally the same as Test 2.",

    "content": "I've updated the statement and I/O to match the rest of the problems' typography.\nThe validators were inconsistent between semicolon-separated and semicolon-terminated, but since the format specified \"separated\" I dropped the trailing ones to make it all consistent.\nThat broke your code in cases where the last command isn't S. So I fixed that.\nYour code also made the road one character shorter than in the input. I assumed that's a side effect of the ¤ to # transition, and fixed that too.\n\nSo all in all, it's good to go for me, I'm approving. But you might want to cross-check I didn't mess up your road widths too much.",
