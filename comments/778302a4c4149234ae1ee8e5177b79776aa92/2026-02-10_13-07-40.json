If there is more than one sequence, return them joined by a -.\" \n\nI assumed that it meant if two starting indices yield sequences of the same length you'd need to return them all joined by dashes. I would suggest wording it more like \"if the longest translation consists of multiple sequences\"",

Is it any codon which is not a stop codon?\n\n* The answers to the above two questions may have been implied by note 1, but it is not clear. Also note 1 uses the term \"start codon\" instead of \"open codon\". As the definitions are critical to the understanding of the rules, I would suggest that note 1 should be deleted, and the definitions should be made clear before describing the translation process.\n\n* Or should all the mentions of \"open codon\" be changed to \"start codon\" instead? The latter term seems to be more appropriate as a name to indicate it is opposite of \"stop codon\".\n\n* Step 2: Please change \"an stop codon\" to \"a stop codon\".\n\nCover picture\n* Suggest to upload a cover picture for the puzzle.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "Thank you for following up and inviting me to solve the puzzle 😆\n\nI think the contribution should be kept as a puzzle and the difficulty can be kept as Easy:\n\n* It took me just slightly less than 15 minutes to write up the first \"working\" solution to the puzzle (though not passing all the cases, further on that below), and that excludes the time for reading and understanding the statement, which I had already done when I commented earlier.\n\n* I initially thought I might have to optimise my Python solution to read each string in a single go instead of 3 iterations for each starting index, but it turns out such optimisation isn't necessary.\n\nCases\n* In Validator 3, why is the output for \"AUGAAAUGAAAAAUGAAAUGA\" \"MK-MK\" instead of \"MKNEM\"?\n\n* I've also got different answers from you for one input in Validator 5 and one input in Validator 8, but I'd wait for the answer to the above question first - in the hope that they may point to the same issue.\n\n* The only difference betwen Test 3 and Test 4 is that the third input string in Test 4 doesn't appear in Test 3. Please delete Test 3, or split the input strings between the tests.\n\n* The only difference betwen Validator 3 and Validator 4 is that the third input string in Validator 4 doesn't appear in Validator 3. Please delete Validator 3, or split the input strings between the validators.\n\nStub generator\n* Please change \"line\" to \"rna\" for consistency.\n\nCover picture\n* Pending.\n\nThanks again.",

    "content": "It doesn't end in an stop codon.\n\nThe example is a bit different in that it doesn't feature this case: an index with an unterminated sequence. A better example would be:\n\nAUGCCCAAA (and the rna stops here)\nAUG-CCC-AAA (starting index = 0)\nMPK (current sequence)\n\nThe solution here should be an empty string but since we guarantee the existence of a unique solution such a rna will never occur.\n\nSince this never reaches a stop codon you never store the current sequence (as now stated by point 2).\n\n--\n\nIn practice (as far as I understand) the ribosome starts storing the amino acids into the protein the moment it reads a start codon, but it isn't until reaching a CLOSED state that it releases the new protein (sequence of amino acids).\n\nThere is a very telling animation in the link in the notes that I repost here:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)\n\nThe legend for easier searching:\nA ribosome translating a protein that is secreted into the endoplasmic reticulum (tRNAs colored dark blue)\n\nIf the sequence is not terminated (=reaches a stop codon), it just remains inside the ribosome and it makes sense to ignore (=not store it / print it) as we do in the puzzle here.",

    "content": "Thank you for the detailed explanation!\n\nI get it now. I just have to remove the part of my original code which stores the unstored sequence at the end of the progress to pass all the tests and validators.\n\nYes, it's important to mention that a sequence is stored only at step 2. It should be sufficient without emphasising that any unstored sequence is ignored?\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhile I was verifying that each case indeed had a unique solution, I had an interesting finding. Out of 118 input strings ([L0, L1, L2] below denotes the lengths of the sequences formed for starting indices 0, 1 and 2 respectively, and ignoring the fact that only 112 input strings are unique):\n\n• majority (78): [>0, 0, 0] (#0 is the answer)\n\n• some (14): [0, >0, 0] (#1 is the answer)\n\n• some (12): [0, 0, >0] (#2 is the answer)\n\n• some (12): [>0, 0, >0] (either #0 or #2 is the answer)\n\n• just one: [>0, >0, 0] (#1 is the answer)\n\n• just one: [>0, >0, >0] (#0 is the answer)\n\nThat doesn't look very random to me!\n\n* * * * *\n\nNow just two more comments in addition to the cover picture:\n\nGoal\n* In the Example, please change \"an open codon\" to \"a start codon\".\n\nCases\n* I've generated some cases which all cover a situation not covered by your cases: the lengths of some of the \"joined\" sequences are the same, but their lengths of just the amino acids are different.\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/dELc3x3p\n(The link will expire after 2 weeks.)\n\nCase D is very interesting because while the joined sequence where starting index = 2 is the longest, it doesn't contain the most amino acids.\n\nCase J is kind of interesting because the equal-length joined sequences have their number of amino acids differ by 2 instead of 1.\n\nPlease consider including them in the puzzle. And if possible, generate another case similar to case D.\n\nThanks again.",

    "content": "- Added this after the description of the translation (not sure if enough?)\n>> \"Note that the sequences are only stored when scanning a stop codon (2). That implies that if, for a given index, the translation process terminates in an OPENED state, the current sequence is lost.\"\n\n- Yeah they are not random at all. The first tests are handmade, and the generator is recycled from another version that guaranteed some conditions that are no longer relevant here and affect the starts/stops.\nIf you want to lose some gray matter this is the code:\nhttps://bpa.st/HKEA\n\n--\n\nAh I didn't test for that lol, nice catch.\n\n- Done (open -> start)\n- Merged Small (3) & Edges (4)\n- Added new test 4 with length considerations\n\nThe way the tests in 4 are done is very simple:\nYou want the three translations to be (MMM, M, M-M) so you just start with AUGx3 + UGA + C (for the offset) + AUGUGA + C (for the offset) + AUGUGA AUGUGA.\nAnd that gives you three tests if you add a C or 2xC at the start (so that the solution index also changes)\n\n10 strings gives a good but not perfect coverage but I think it should be enough.\n\nThe first string for instance is (MMM, M-M, M-M) with triple equality.\nThe last 3 strings are case D (MMMM, M-M-M, M)\n\nThe validators are, like in other cases, obtained with C -> A since it doesn't affect the translation (here).\n\n--\n\nI guess I will add a cover picture.",
