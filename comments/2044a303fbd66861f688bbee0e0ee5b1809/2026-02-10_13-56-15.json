    "content": "I would exclude 2 from the possibilities for N, since there is no smaller prime than two, so the definition doesn't apply well. \nOne could argue that your definition says that 2 is a strong prime since there is no smaller prime so the first two conditions don't apply and you fall into the \"Otherwise the prime is strong\" case. But this is not consistent with the mathematical definition of a strong prime.",
