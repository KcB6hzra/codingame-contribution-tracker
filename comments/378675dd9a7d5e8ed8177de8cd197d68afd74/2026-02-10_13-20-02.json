I have attempted solving the puzzle this way when I created it and it took me quite some time - I think more than 15 minutes - so I will try again and see depending on my performance whether I keep it or not.\n\nThank you for your feedback, this means the world to me ! : )",

Instead it's a very loose description of a characteristic of the test cases input data.\n\nI think it would be overly complicated in this challenge to clearly state the input limitation, so I think it would be much better replace this with an explicit description of a rounding strategy.\n\nSo if you clearly state a rounding strategy and include a test to test for it, that will likely be much easier for everyone to grok and code for.\n\nfor example that statement could be replaced with: \"If the answer is none integer it should be rounded down to 1 decimal place\"",
