    "content": "Hello VinceKanabo,\n\nNice puzzle, simple to get a first solution but could be made a bit more difficult to make it more interesting.\n\nIn the description some players might not understand what you mean by the \"area of the block\". Maybe it could be better described as the external surface, or the sum of the area of the 6 faces of the block.\n\nFor an harder version, we could increase the max value of N to a million or more (I tested my solution below up to 10^10), requiring players to be smarter in their solutions:\n- the max value is always 2+4*n (i.e. putting all blocks in a single row)\n- the min value can be computed using 2 loops instead of 3, using the cubic and square roots to limit the search, and testing first if the chosen value is a divisor of n.\n\nI tested the following Python3 code:\n\nimport math\nn=int(input())\nmax=2+4*n\nmin=max\nfor a in range(1,math.ceil(math.pow(n,1./3.))+1):\n    if (n%a==0):\n        m=n//a\n        for b in range(1,math.ceil(math.sqrt(m))+1):\n            if (m%b==0):\n                c=m//b\n                S=2*(a*b+b*c+a*c)\n                if (S<min):\n                    min=S\nprint(str(min)+\" \"+str(max))\n\nWith it an additional test and validator could be added, that would timeout (take more than a second) on your code:\n\nTest 5\n987654\n350746 3950618\n\nValidator 5\n998877\n847598 3995510",
