    "content": "Yes, I tried solving with Dijkstra's algorithm and got sick of it very quickly.\n\nI then tried a neat algorithm that someone used in my clash (I lost with 75% in my actual clash), and managed to solve it in about 5 minutes.\n\nThe nice algorithm simply uses three nested loops over the n nodes and updates an array of fastest times between any 2 stations to correct it whenever going a->b->c is faster than a->c, then you can simply use that array to read out the time from origin to destination. Much easier to code on the fly than Dijkstra. Still a hard clash though!",
