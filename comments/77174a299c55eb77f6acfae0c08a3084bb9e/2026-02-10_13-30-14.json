    "content": "I tend to agree that Reverse Mode would be great for this, as it is a bit too simple to just find the average and print that many *'s, but having to determine that it's an average of numerals, and the outputs is the answer in *'s may throw people off just enough for it to be worth the extra puzzle.  For an extra curveball, maybe include some random non-sense characters that do not contribute to the average, for example the data received contains $%! garbage, so in essence that is skipped and the average is taken of only data that can be processed (numerals).",
