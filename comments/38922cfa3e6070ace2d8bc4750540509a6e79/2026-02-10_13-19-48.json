    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: First, this   coding exercise is a great way to practice problem solving and critical thinking skills. It requires the programmer to think through the problem and come up with a logical solution to the challenge. Additionally, this exercise is beneficial because it encourages the programmer to become familiar with a wide range of programming concepts, such as ASCII values and string manipulation. Finally, this exercise provides a great way to practice debugging and testing code, as the programmer is required to validate the message ID and ensure that it is correct.",

    "content": "I don't know if there is room for clashes that ask for redundant information.  Maybe this clash could use less output and more thoughtful use of input.\n\nFor example there are at least 50 \"add the character values up\" clashes.  Maybe try something different?  Although, it would make for some interesting fun to play every single clash that adds character values one after the other.\n\nHave fun.",
