In fact, I do not remember seeing \"dividable\" used in any math text I read. Also, the sentence is not very precise, as in fact you mean:\n\n\"Angle is provided in degrees and is an odd multiple of 45\".\n\nBut overall, the puzzle is quite interesting, and could be fun to solve. Good luck.",

Presenting patterns of the same size (let's say 5 and 6 to check both even and odd dimensions) at first, and a big one (20 or 30) at the end could test that.\n- performing a symetry instead of  a rotation (a pattern with an axial symetry could work with such a bug, if the angle is well chosen)\n- wrong angle modulo (first tests should present angles withtin the [0,360[ range and only then go beyond 360°)",

It is very similar to https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/470ee2d6180bd41469770d13396894d8b61 , with the same issue regarding the ridiculously small number of rotations (see my comment there) *and* with this strange restriction of \"angle % 90 = 45\".\n\nEither you want to have diamond-shape only with smalls angles, and I do believe that this is more suitable for a Clash of code.
