    "content": "I have made some grammatical corrections to the English translation, and I added some stub generator code.\n\nHowever, unless I'm missing something in the stub generator syntax, I don't think that you can have paired lines of input like you currently have it setup.  It also seems as though you can't have space-separated authors and a title with spaces in it on the same line.\n\nSo the stub generator that I wrote assumes that you will have [[N]] lines of just titles, followed by [[N]] lines of space-separated authors.\n\nI have not updated the Input section to reflect this, though. I'm pretty sure you will need to somehow change the Input so that it will conform to something that the code generator can produce.",
