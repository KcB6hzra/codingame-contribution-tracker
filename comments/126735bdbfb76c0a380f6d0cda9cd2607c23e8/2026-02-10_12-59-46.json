    "content": "Goal\n* Please rewrite as follows for clarity (the example has been deleted because an example has been shown in Example section):\n\nIn a game, every attacker and defender belongs to one of three types: {{Grass}}, {{Water}}, and {{Fire}}.\n\n• {{Grass}} is effective against {{Water}}.\n• {{Water}} is effective against {{Fire}}.\n• {{Fire}} is effective against {{Grass}}.\n• In all other cases, the attack is considered useless.\n\nEach battle consists of one attacker and one or more defenders. The defender types are provided as a single string, with individual types separated by {{+}}.\n\nFor each battle, you must determine the <<result>> of the attack based on how many defender types the attacker is effective against:\n\n• If the attacker is effective against <<more than half>> of the defenders, the result is {{Effective}}.\n• If the attacker is effective against <<less than half>> of the defenders, the result is {{Useless}}.\n• If the attacker is effective against <<exactly half>> of the defenders, the result is {{Average}}.\n\nInput\n* Please rewrite as follows for clarity:\n\n<<Line 1:>> An integer [[N]] for the number of battles.\n<<Next 2[[N]] lines:>> For each battle:\n • <<Line 1:>> A string representing the type of the attacker.\n • <<Line 2:>> A string representing the type(s) of the defender(s).\n\nOutput\n* Please change \"attack\" to \"battle\".\n\n* Please format \"Effective\", \"Useless\" and \"Average\" as {{constants}} instead of [[variables]].\n\nConstraints\n* Please change 1024 to 10 because N is never greater than 3 in the cases.\n\nCases\n* Each test and its corresponding validator should be similar (but not the same). Hence, please revise Validators 1 to 3 by swapping the order of defenders' types.\n\n* Expand Test 6 and Validator 6 to satisfy the following conditions:\n  • N = 9.\n  \n  • Each attacker-result combination appears exactly once (attacker = Grass/Water/Fire, result = Effective/Useless/Average).\n  \n  • The number of defenders per battle varies, covering all values from 8 to 11 as evenly as possible, i.e. there are battles with 8, 9, 10 and 11 defenders.\n  \n  • Try to test edge situations as much as possible, e.g. [4 effective + 5 useless] or [5 effective + 4 useless] when there are 9 defenders, [4 effective + 6 useless] or [5 effective + 5 useless] or [6 effective + 4 useless] when there are 10 defenders, etc.\n\nThanks.",

There's just a bit more refinement needed to ensure balanced case coverage:\n\n* In the visible tests, when the number of defenders is EVEN, there are several \"Average\" outcomes (Tests 4, 6 and 7) but no \"Effective\" outcomes. Please add an \"EVEN + Effective\" scenario to Test 7, without modifying the existing battles.\n\n* In the validators, when the number of defenders is greater than 1 and ODD, there are only \"Effective\" outcomes (Validators 5 and 6) but no \"Useless\" outcomes.
