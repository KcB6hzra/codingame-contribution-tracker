    "content": "Very nice addition to the Optimization puzzles.\nExcellent responses to all the feedback.\nI'm ready to approve, but I think there is 1 more change.\n\nIt's important that the Validators are random, as they are.\nBut I think the Test Cases should not be random.\nHere's why. Imagine I'm writing my program (with some bugs).\nI need to modify my program, then re-run it against the same secret word. If the secret word for the Test Case changes every time, it's much more difficult to debug my program. Once my program is bug-free, I want to Submit and have it scored against randomly generated words in the Validators.\n\nLooking at Bulls & Cows 2, that is how it was done.",

I loved Wordle and making it a game sounds like a great idea.\n\nI have some questions before moving on:\n- Can you share just the source code of the game (not the solution words)? You mentioned v1 was multiplayer - do you have a link with previous feedback?\n- I know wordle is optimized based on letter occurrence probability in source thesaurus (e.g. see https://jonathanolson.net/wordle-solver/ ). You mentioned \"word is not necessarily real\" - is it random?\n- If words are random (or secret), could a \"perfect\" solution make top of leaderboard decided by RNG? I'm not sure how can this be fixed, but I'm giving it a thought.\n\nThanks for creating this game. I imagine you prefer making this optimization above a puzzle, so I'll think how can it work in case the random part breaks the challenge.",

    "content": "I didn't notice the forum message, thanks for commenting here.\n\nPreviously, there was a fixed mapping between validators and words. For instance, validator1 -> word1, validator2 -> word2, validator3 -> word2, and so on, up to validatorN -> wordN. Each validator could only point to a single specific word. \nThis has now changed, validators are no longer restricted to pointing to their original assigned word. They can now point to any random word that has the same length as their original assigned word. This means that some words may appear more than once, but there is no guarantee that any particular word will appear more than once.\n\nAdding more words could potentially improve the randomness, but it cannot guarantee that no word will appear more than once. \nI'm not sure how critical it is to avoid a word from appearing more than once to ensure randomness in this particular context. \nI would appreciate your input on this matter.",

    "content": "I think a word or two being repeated once is acceptable, given that you have no control over randomness. But having a dozen of words repeated two or three times is a bit too much. It's just like ordinary puzzles having duplicated validators.\n\nGiven that there are 50 validators in total, would it be possible to allocate e.g. 50 words to each validator, making it a total of 2500 different words? That will ensure that no two validators test the same word. During the allocation, you can at the same time ensure that some validators test words with unique letters only, while other validators test words with 2 or more repeated letters.\n\nThanks.",
