That guarantees correctness, but it’s often overkill for small graphs and quickly becomes impractical on dense ones. A smarter angle might be to reframe it as two optimization problems: how to best approximate a k-coloring, and how to find a near-maximum clique. That way, you keep things efficient and flexible.",

I like the idea, graph coloring is very nice. a few remarks/opinions (but I have not tested yet)\n\n- Some images with colored graphs (maybe in the examples) would make it very simple to understand the problem\n\n- I'm not really convinced by the 2 separate problems, as they aren't linked. IIRC if you can prove the largest clique is <k you haven't proven the graph is k-colorable, so players have to solve 2 completely separate problems, as you did in your solution. \nI just think it feels better to be able to get passing tests for 1 problem, and then you can move on to the next. It would also make it easier to understand what to do. Maybe you can do 2 puzzles ?\n\n- This is a very nice and simple example for backtracking, it would make sense to add it to the tags. Are greedy algorithms really relevant here ? same for graph traversal",

    "content": "Personally I would say either easy or medium for the first part (checking if the graph is k-colorable). Most backtracking puzzles are mediums, but this one is not very complex. Actually as of now you can brute force it as well, since the instances are so small\n\nThe clique part is easy, again because the instances are very small and the brute force solution straightforward.\n\nI don't think having both makes the problem harder, just longer. I would advise to separate these 2 into different puzzles, and then for each one, tune the instance size to reach the desired difficulty. \nFor k-coloring, I would make it impossible to brute force 100% of the instances, but possible to solve with naive backtracking - then Easy or Medium is good. Then make an optimization problem for the hard version (I can help with that, if you want). \nFor maximum clique, I would maybe put it in Hard difficulty and make instances large enough to require some kind of clever backtracking algorithm.\n\nalso you can post on the discord server to get more opinions, if you don't get many here. there's time though.

    "content": "The order of explanation is still a bit confusing. \"Graph after coloring\" is the conclusion for \"Graph Coloring\", but it's placed after the \"Clique\" section. I suggest to:\n\n* delete the entire section of \"Graph after coloring\", and\n\n* add \"The graph can be colored with 2 colors while ensuring no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\" before the heading \"Clique\".\n\nAnother point: the statement gave me the impression one must do the coloring in order to find out the largest clique size. But that doesn't seem to be the case. I think it's better to add a note to clarify that.\n\nThanks.",
