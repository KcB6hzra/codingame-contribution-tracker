    "content": "What happens if there is a comma in the sentence? Or three dots? Multiple sentences (Rule 4 seems to imply that we need to split the sentences) ?\nAccording to your solution, we are sure that there is only one sentence, and that the last character is just ignored. And there is no punctuation marks in the sentence. Those constraints must appear in the statement.\nTest 4 and Validator 4 are the same.\nNote: as the transformation is symmetric, you may write reversed strings in the Inputs in order to have the surprise of the output :-)",

I updated the statement to reflect that.\n- The Goal states \"an input sentence\", I thought that was sufficient to exclude multiple sentences, I'll clarify that.\n- I reversed Test #3 to make reverse a bit easier.\n- Validator 4 and test 4 are similar, but not the same.",
