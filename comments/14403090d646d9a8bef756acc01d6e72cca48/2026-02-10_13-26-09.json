    "content": "The puzzle is appropriate for CoC, but the formatting isn't great and it's quite dull. I would revise the Statement to be:\n--------------------\nYou have a class of [[n]] students. Each student is assigned a number from 1 to [[n]]. Every day, the students write their assigned number on the board as they enter the classroom, generating a list of numbers [[t]]. At the end of the day, you have to submit the attendance into the school records for each student from {{1}} to [[n]], labeling each as either \"present' or \"absent.\" The formatting is as shown in the example below.\n\n<<Example: >>\n[[n]]=8\n[[t]]=7 8 5 2 1\n1 is in [[t]], so print \"1 is present\"\n2 is in [[t]], so print \"2 is present\"\n3 is not in [[t]], so print \"3 is absent\"\nand so on.\n\n-----------------------------\nIf you adopt these changes, you should of course change the input and output fields as well.",

    "content": "1. Please refer to the example in the contribution guidelines to:\n(a) properly present your Inputs and Outputs in terms of wordings using the terms such as Line 1, integer.\n(b) properly format all variables.\nhttps://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/statement#guidelines\n\n2. Please refer to point 4 of the contribution guidelines and rearrange your test cases and validators:\nhttps://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/contribution-guidelines\n\n3. Variable names should be consistent (you first use T and N then use t and n to refer to the same variables).\n\n4. Constraints: please combine the two constraints on n as one.\n\n5. In the Goal section, for clearer presentation, I think it is better to add a new line before the example.\n\n6. Output section: suggest to use \"is present\" instead of \"is here\".\n\nThanks.",
