    "content": "- Please specify the coordinate formatting as \"[[latitude]]{{,}} [[longitude]]\". Your original formatting \"+32.306421, -122.614584\" is better suited as an example. Please also state whether the input latitude and longitude values will always be expressed as 6 decimal places.\n\n- For the Fastest and Shortest modes, the problem statement should clearly state how the antipode of a location should be computed. I find the description at https://www.antipodesmap.com/ sufficiently succinct; below is a rephrased version:\n\n\"Mathematically, the geographical coordinates of the antipode are:\n• <<Latitude>>: convert the given [[latitude]] to the opposite hemisphere by negating its value (e.g.: +45 → -45);\n• <<Longitude>>: subtract the magnitude (without sign) of the given [[longitude]] from {{180}}, and convert the result to the opposite hemisphere via negation (e.g.: -60 → +120).\"\n\nAlternatively, to not specify the formula so explicitly, you could consider utilising the NSEW notation, or explaining how the hemispheres are notated as +/-.\n\n- As an edge case, please include one test case where latitude = +0, and another test case where longitude = +0. Please also explain what the expected output should be for each case in the problem description (e.g. forcing 0 to always be displayed as +0.000000, displaying longitude as +180.000000 instead of -180.000000, etc.)",

    "content": "Thanks for the detailed feedback.\n\nTwo of them are things that I considered, but decided against in the end.\n\n1. The +0.000000 edge cases\nHaving a longitude opposite +0 would not have a well-defined value since +180 = -180, so we would have to force a convention on the problem, which to me just makes it less fun to solve.\nThen for latitude +0, the problem is that in some languages if you sprintf 0*-1it will display as \"-0\". This is the case in Ruby. That's why I chose to completely avoid 0.000000 and instead just went close with e.g. +0.000001.\nHaving to fix an issue like \"-0\" in-clash is just a real headache imo and takes from the fun of the clash.\n\n2. Explaining how to calculate the antipode\nTo me, telling the player how to calculate it would turn this from a clash of understanding the problem into just a clash of coding a pair of formulae and formatting the output.\nI figure by explaining that the antipode needs to be on the opposite side of the world, and explaining the coordinate system, then figuring out the lat/lon of the opposite point is deducible from the statement. Also, it's easy enough to deduce from tests if the user isn't good at geometry.\n\n3. The input format\nThanks, I've updated that to match your suggestion.",

    "content": "1. I completely understand the reason behind excluding the +0 edge cases, and I agree that it would make things less fun. However, this is not made clear to the player, who may be left needlessly wondering what to do in this case. If including an edge case is not the preferred way to go, consider updating the constraints to explicitly state that both latitude and longitude will never be exactly 0.\n\n2. I see your vision. Having done some googling on latitude/longitude coordinate system and the antipode calculator, I now have more context as to how this system works. That being said, what to do with the latitude/longitude ranges was not initially obvious to me, which is why I raised the suggestion. I do still think that the problem description is slightly more context-heavy than I would prefer, but I am ok to leave it as is and see what others think.",
