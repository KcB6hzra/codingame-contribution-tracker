I decided to test their code here in the IDE because I suspected (correctly) that they got 100% on the test cases.\n\nThe issue is that Validator 3 is the only test or validator that has three input phrases that all have a space connecting them to the commonWord. This means that some algorithms include the space in the common word and forget to remove it when they print the Answer.\n\nIt would be best if you edited a test case to match this, so  that clashers can fix this problem in-clash, rather than only realise after submitting what they thought was a 100% submission.",

But still feasible.\n\nOne thing tho, not sure if it was wanted but, there is no test to validate that the commonWord appears in all 3 inputs. I mean, you can find the commonWord from only 2 inputs. \n\nTake your solution for example and omit the bool2 check on line 59 and it still works.\nbool bool3 = bool0 && bool1;// && bool2;\n\nSuch test might be something like ...\nBLACKBOARD\nWOODEN BOARD\nWOODEN OAR\n\nThen again, it would make it even harder 🤨",

    "content": "I do like the clash, but I am slightly hesitant about approving; it took me about 10 minutes and a couple of errors, difficulty feels at least above average for clashes. I will wait for some other reactions to get more comfortable with clicking 'solvable within 5 minutes'.\n\nWhat partly took some minutes for me is that I started looking to it as reverse, and from that saw the pattern of that always at least once a common word separated by space was included - but in IDE I realized that that information is technically not known to Fastest and Shortest players, so I should not use that knowledge. So, I was a bit hesitant on my coding approach (can I use the space or not). What might have helped me is a kind of final answer on this in the Statement, like 'Every case has a mix of phrases with and without space', or, if you do not want that to be a given, 'Cases can be a mixture of phrases with or without space' (these suggestions are definitely not perfect, but I hope you understand the gist). -- But maybe that is only a solution for the special case in which someone starts reverse and moves to fastest (like me), that in reality will never happen.",

    "content": "Indeed, words/phrases implies enough - but during a clash (at least for me personally) implications give me a nugget of doubt; for that reason I prefer clear cut rules (and, as a non-native English speaker I did not realize that phrase is always multiple words, which might additionally explain my doubt).\n\nI do really admire how you managed to put an actual existing thing (the Remote Associative Test) into the size of a clash - it is certainly doable within 15 minutes thanks to your set-up after all. However, it almost feels a shame to put this one in a Clash: during the Clash no one bothers about the interesting lessons, it is just eyes on the timer. So, that makes me wonder: can some aspects be added to increase the difficulty, to push it just over the clash/puzzle border? As a puzzle, it feels very nice to deal with some real-life aspect and getting a grasp on it - even coding a solution on it yourself. Some suggestions for added difficulty:\n- Include 'Not valid', for situations where no common word can be found;\n- Include some not valid situations that seem valid (rice bag / price tag / trice; answer would be rice with my current code), but include a rule that the common word cannot be in the middle of a word (or some other phrasing of rules that rule out rice as part of price tag);\n- Add the synonym option (from your Wikipedia option: same/tennis/head, with answer match, because of matchhead, tennis match and same being synonym for match), by including a thesaurus.\n\n---But it is totally up to you, and if some others start commenting 'all is well' I might even feel comfortable with approving it in its current state, under the assumption I was just slow in yesterday's trial.",

Your modifications like all Caps and including a case without spaces do shave of some seconds of hesitation on what methods to use, while you stay very much true to the original idea and the origin, which is admirable as well.",
