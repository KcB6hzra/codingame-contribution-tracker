    "content": "The assignment of difficulty level can be highly subjective. So, it's better to rely on more objective criteria. I find the rules of thumb by Wontonimo (another moderator) useful:\n\n(quote begins here)\nMy rules of thumb for difficulty is as follows : \n* if/else and possibly a loop is 'easy'.  \n* Recursion, DFS, BFS, Minimax is 'medium'.  \n* Tricky or mathy stuff with multiple steps is 'hard' or 'very hard'\n* Very hard: mini research projects requiring a lot of local coding and my own test case development\n(quote ends here)\n\nNot saying that they should be strictly applied, but they're good enough to be the starting point for consideration.\n\nI would say this puzzle requires more than simple if/else and loops and qualifies to be Medium. It is fair to say, though, the puzzle is at the easier end of Medium.\n\n@ _O-MEGA, while it is impressive that you have reached Level 30 and finished almost all the CG puzzles of all difficulty levels, they only make up a very small portion of the puzzles available on the CG platform. Solving some community-created puzzles may give you a better feel of how difficulty levels are assigned.",
