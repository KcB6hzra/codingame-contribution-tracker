    "content": "Nice straightforward puzzle, but it took me a few read-throughs to understand everything.\n\nInstead of \"an organism\", I think specifying a particular organism would make the problem sound more engaging and concise! For example, consider the chosen organism to be an axolotl:\n\n\"You're a biologist studying the biodiversity of axolotls! <explain quadrat sampling> From the quadrat data, you can calculate:\n- <<Species frequency:>> the <<percentage>> of quadrats containing axolotls\n- <<Species density:>> the <<total number>> of axolotls found, divided by the <<total area>> of all quadrats.\n- <<Percentage cover>> (for a quadrat): the <<number>> of axolotls found, divided by the <<area>> of the quadrat, multiplied by {{100}}.\"\n\nAlso, you can consider making each quadrat a visual input :) That would also follow the actual definition of percentage cover in quadrat sampling. A simple MxN grid of character strings should suffice.",
