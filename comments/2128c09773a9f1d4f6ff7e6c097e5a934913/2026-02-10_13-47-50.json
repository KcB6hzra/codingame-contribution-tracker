From the description it sounded like there would be multiple switches and we'd have to find the best route through them.\n\n(2) Wouldn't it make more sense for each line to have a list of numbers representing individuals, instead of assuming everyone on the same path has equal value?",

I see how I can write a solution (Row number starting at index 1 of where Q*V is minimum value)  But the statement doesn't even come close to explaining how to get to that answer.  Should have never been approved.  I have zero reason to know that the \"arbitrary value\" should be multiplied by the number of people.",
