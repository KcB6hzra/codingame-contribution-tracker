    "content": "The statement is not clear enough concerning the calculation of accuracy.\n\nThe statement explains the characters should be compared case-insensitively. When reading this, we may believe that only the alphabetic characters should be considered. So it would be better to explicitly tell that even non-alphanumeric characters have to be considered, and that the comparison is case insensitive.\n\nFor example, with the test \"Barely passed\".\n\nWhen considering all characters, the number of significant characters is 10. The scores are :\n\n0.8\n1.0\n1.0\n0.9\n1.0\n0.4\n1.0\n0.8\n0.8\n\nIt is consistant with the expected answer.\n\nIf we believe only alphabetic characters should be considered, the number of significant ones is 9. The scores are :\n\n0.7777777777777778\n1.0\n1.0\n0.8888888888888888\n1.0\n0.3333333333333333\n1.0\n0.7777777777777778\n0.7777777777777778\n\nAnd it changes one of the pass/fail result.",
