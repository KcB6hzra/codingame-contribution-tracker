    "content": "Nice puzzle.\n\nHowever, I would suggest two minor changes to the solution code:\n1. I would change lines 9, 11 and 13 from \"if\" to \"elif\" because logically, \"i\" can only be one of these things.\n2. To visually distinguish the code segments evaluating \"i\" and the test \"if level <= 0\", I would add a blank line before line 15.\n\nOther than that, good work!",
