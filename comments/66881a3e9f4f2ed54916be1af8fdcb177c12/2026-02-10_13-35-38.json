    "content": "⚠️ Modified the contribution.\nComment: \nChanged constraint \"1 <= [[Day]] <= 1000\" to\n\"5 <= [[Day]] <= 1000\" since none of the test cases currently test numbers below 7. For Shortest mode, this makes a huge difference, because dealing with cases with [[Day]] = 1 or 2 would possibly throw errors if you have taken shortcuts in your code.\nAlso, made a minor grammar edit \"With [[Rabbit]] rabbit being...\" -> \"With [[Rabbit]] rabbits being...\".",

    "content": "First, I like the idea. It is more original than many clashes.\n\nBut I am sorry; I have to disagree with the previous comments. For me the problem is not clear. I think that the proposed solution does not match the description.\n\nHow I understood the problem:\n- There are R rabbits born on the first day.\n- In the second day, these R rabbits will \"create\" R*B babies.\n\nHow you solved the problem:\n- There are R rabbits born on the first day.\n- No new rabbit born on day 2\n- On day 3, the R rabbits finally \"create\" babies.\n\n@Alex-1 and @Flaaamort Did you try to solve the problem *before* looking at the solution? Was it really clear for you? I am asking, because I may be the only one who is confused :)",
