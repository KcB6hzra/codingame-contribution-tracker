Any other suggestion ?\n\nThe brute force solution I've coded is certainly not the most elegant one, but it seems to be thorough. I'm curious to see how others will deal with the problem.\n\nIt is certainly not an easy puzzle but I'm not quite sure if it should be Medium, Hard or Very Hard, so I set it to Hard while waiting for your comments.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nVincent",
