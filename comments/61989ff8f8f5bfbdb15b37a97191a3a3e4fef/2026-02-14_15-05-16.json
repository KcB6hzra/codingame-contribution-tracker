    "content": "Goal section\n* Please add a sentence to indicate the goal of the puzzle (to find out the cypher alphabet instead of decrypt the given message?).\n\n* Please change \"crypted\" to \"encrypted\" (as \"crypt\" is not a verb; same reason for similar changes below).\n\n* Please change \"simple, replace\" to \"simple: replace\".\n\n* Please change \"you\" to \"your\".\n\n* Please change \"uncrypted\" to \"unencrypted\".\n\n* Please change \"crypting alphabet\" to \"cypher alphabet\" (side note: Google search shows more results for \"cypher alphabet\" than \"cyphertext alphabet\").\n\n* Please change \"crypt\" to \"encrypt\".\n\n* Please change \"english\" to \"English\".\n\n* Please change \"originaly\" to \"originally\".\n\n* Suggest to split the middle paragraph into three. The second paragraph may begin with \"That works\", and the third one may begin with \"The likelihood of a text\".\n\n* Is the sentence \"to not to make long words seem less likely, you may normalize them.\" relevant to this puzzle? If so, what is the way to normalize them? By using the given formula? If not, suggest to delete it to avoid confusion.\n\n* Please explain what i and i + 1 refer to in the formula.\n\n* Please explain how P(i, i + 1) is calculated. Or will they be found in the link you're going to include in the statement?\n\n* What does P(Markov) = -3.1812 denote? I mean, what is the implication if the value is more negative or less negative? Can the value be zero or positive?\n\n* The notations are kind of confusing. Correct me if I'm wrong: It seems to me that P() indicates probabilities where possible values are limited between 0 and 1. But P(Markov) is a negative value you term as \"likelihood\" - so P() here looks like something else and another notation should be used.\n\n* Please change \"usualy\" to \"usually\".\n\n* Suggest to change \"calculus method\" to \"calculation method\" (I'm not sure about this).\n\n* Suggest to add some explanation or an example on how the likelihood figures are used in decryption.\n\n* Please explain how the following are treated (e.g. ignored?) in the calculation of likelihood:\n(a) case of letters\n(b) non-letters e.g. spaces, digits and other characters\n\n* Distribution percentages table: Please show fewer letters per line as the lines may not always be shown fully. For example, my window shows A to U only. It should look better if you use 4 lines instead of 3.\n\n* \"The complete list is given below\". / \"I will soon enough put a link to the whole stats\": List to be added, and the last paragraph to be tidied up before the approval phase.\n\nInput section\n* Line 1 description: A bit confusing to me right now. I'll wait for more explanation as commented above before I comment on this description again.\n\n* Please change \"Everything else\" to \"Line 2\".\n\n* Please format \"text\" as a [[variable]].\n\n* Line 2 description: A bit weird, as while it is the text to decypher, the requirement is not to decypher it. Again, I will comment on this description again later.\n\nMy comment is too long, so I'll continue in another one.",
