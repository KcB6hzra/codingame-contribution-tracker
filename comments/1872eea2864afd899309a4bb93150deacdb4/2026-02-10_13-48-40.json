Here are just a few concerns.\n\nThe last sentence \"than the deeper point of either of these valleys\" does not make sense, I think you mean something like \"take/return the deepest point overall\".\n\nThe \"next to each other\" definition of components is slightly ambiguous as \"each other\" might be interpreted as \"pairwise\".\n\nThe bounds are not accurate enough regarding the actual data, in particular \"N<200\" while it only goes up to 20. I guess it's because you did not foresee the limit on the size of the input. As having large heights is not important, it might be interesting to add one testcase as large as possible with only 1-9 heights.",

Well I'd be interested in seeing your solution then :) It's not a bad amount of complex by any means, but definitely beyond any of the easy puzzles I played on CG.\n2.\n3\n5\n2 4 2\n4 3 4 \n2 4 2\n\nIn my understanding, the answer to this test case would be a \"1\", because there is only 1 lake on the map, between the 4's at the 3 spot in the middle. This is because, while there may be a \"2\" on the corner, we assume that everything outside of our map is at 0 and back to sea level. If it is not, then my answer would actually be \"3\" because I assume that everything around the map is a huge wall containing all the water, it went up to 5, so the 4's  are covered and the whole thing is a lake right now.\n\nBasically, clarification on the behaviours of the edges and the water would be helpful here:\nI'd feel saying the edges are 0 is the most intuitive, but otherwise saying they can all assume to be H or something -> either way a hard fast numeric rule I feel is lacking.\n\nAdditionally, can you clarify the behaviour of the water? Looking at the new case\n8 9 9 8 7\n8 2 3 2 7\n6 4 5 4 8\n9 8 4 2 7\n7 8 9 6 5\n\nIt seems the water got to height 5. But then with my understanding of the water level rising, there would be no lake, because the entire middle is surrounded by heights greater than 5, so the water would never have flowed in to enter.\n\n3. Thanks\n4. Thanks\n\n5.(new) -> can you flip N & H? It's weird to get the amount of rows to come, THEN additional data, then the rows. H N h[] would be more straightforward.",

    "content": "I rejected because it's a bad puzzle.\n\nNot because the description is confusing, but because the concept that it attempts to describe is confused. You can see from the longer comment thread that the author does not understand how water flows - specifically, that disconnected lakes should not have the same height. \nThat's why he's having so much trouble finding an unambiguous way to say \"all lakes have water up to height H\". It contradicts our intuition about floods.\n\nSo whereas his other puzzles did use a \"map of fields and lakes,\" this one requires us to pick one number out of an array based on an arbitrary criterion. It doesn't fit the theme.\n\nAlthough the author has returned and made some superficial improvements after his original nonresponsiveness, I don't think the fundamental problem can be salvaged without turning this into the existing \"flood the world\" puzzle.",

    "content": "Ok, thanks for your answer. I feel like the problem is not bad, but the statement certainly is. The problem literally is \"find the smallest value inside the largest 4-connected component of values <=H\", while the statement tries to make it look like some quirky flood fill problem.\nRemoving the \"flood part\" of it, as well as H, and simply giving a topographic map (with negative values under water) and ask for the deepest point in the largest sea/lake would probably make it OK.",
