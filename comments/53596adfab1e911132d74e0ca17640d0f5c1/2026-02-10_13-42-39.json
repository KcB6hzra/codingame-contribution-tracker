    "content": "The default code for Clojure throws an exception, but other than that I don't think there are any glaring issues with this puzzle.\n\nRegarding the goal statement, there are a few things I might consider changing. First, having  \"...all switches in series must be on...\" instead of \"... switches in series must be all on...\" on line 5 of the goal statement. Second, I might add something about how circuits can have multiple sets of switches in series or in parallel. When I attempted to solve the puzzle I initially assumed that there would only be one set of switches in series and one set of parallel switches and had to make a few tweaks to my solution when I reached the later test cases, but I could attribute that misunderstanding to me not reading the goal statement closely enough. \n\nOverall a very nice puzzle. Once the Clojure default code issue is fixed and the goal statement is polished up a little more you can count on my vote for approval,",

I think just [[SWITCH]] is fine. If you want to change it, then in the statement you should rephrase \"Switch identifiers are unique\" to \"Each [[SWITCH]] has a unique name.\" Also in the input, \"the switch [[IDENTIFIER]] Tom manipulated\" can be \"the [[SWITCH]] that Tom toggled.\" I think toggled is a better word in either case.",

The Clojure code that gets generated does not consume the \"end of line\" character when reading integer into C or A. As a result, the next \"read-line\" returns an empty string and inputs get mixed up.\n\nBelow is a sample to illustrate this. If you remove the comments before \"(read-line)\", the code works.
