It was fun to figure out the optimal planting location to maximize tree growth within the given rules. I would be curious to see a more challenging version of the puzzle with additional rules or constraints.",

    "content": "The answer to validator \"One tree\" should be 23 and not 22, with the seed being planted at (2,0) or any of the symmetrical points.\n\nI didn't fully read your answer so I can't suggest you a fix but there seems to be a bug in your noNeedToPlant logic that is discarding this option. Just switching this line:\n\nif( MAP_Tiles_Start_With_Trees[i][j].noNeedToPlant == false )\n\nto \n\nif( true )\n\nwill indeed yield 23.\n\n\nOn another note, I'd probably avoid the adult keyword and just talk about seeds / trees*. Maybe it's just me but I spent 5 mins to realize that I had to count only the \"Y\" and not \"Y\" + \"X\" (since I assumed the \"X\" was also considered a tree because of this adult thingy)\n\n* something like:\n\n-Seeds need 10 years to become a tree.\n-Trees produce 4 seeds around them after one year.\n-Trees may be already present on your land, they will produce seed after one year too.",
