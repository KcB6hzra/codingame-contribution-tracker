    "content": "Nice submission!\n\nGoing to say that in theory, since this problem was already in itself a buffed version of your original clash, if you wanted to bump up the difficulty of this problem again, you could force factorizations of numbers even as large as twice the length of this using more complicated factorization algorithms (see: pollard-rho and others), which would add an additional layer to the problem and would make for a nice tall problem.\n\nAnyway, with that out of the way, there's one test case type that I feel should be added, which is a test case with many prime factors (as opposed to the highly composites, which focus specifically on maximizing any type of factors), so e.g. 2*3*5*7*11*13*17*19*23*29*31. This is just to block out any weird O(f*4^p) algorithms (where f is the number of factors of any type and p is the number of unique prime factors). \n\nI don't think many submissions will fail this test case, but I can see this feasibly happen if somehow the mask of the disallowed additional prime factors had to be ran in a double for loop, in addition to the loop that runs each factor. Something like this could maybe happen if an algorithms runs with some constraints on both A and B.\n\nAs a note, there's a lot of room for picking which 10 prime numbers to include, if going for the maximum below 10^14, since the smallest 10 primes leaves a product of around 2*10^12. There's also enough leniency for the test case to have some prime factors have exponents greater than 1, so e.g. replacing 3 with 3^2 and 2 with 2^4.",
