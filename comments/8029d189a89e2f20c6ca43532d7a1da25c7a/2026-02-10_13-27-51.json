I didn't understand the assignment until after reading the tests.\n\nThe first line:\nCompute the rank sum for n ordered sequences of letters.\n\nmade no sense to me as I never heard of \"rank sum\" before.\n\nthe next line:\n(Rank is 1-indexed: 1st letter has rank 1, 2nd rank 2, etc.)\n\nDid not help me, as it implies that rank is an established name for something I should know what is.\n\nYou could change to something like:\nCompute the rank sum for n ordered sequences of letters\n\nThe ranks are the 1-based index for each letter in the input string.\nEXAMPLE\n\nINPUT\nLine 1: A M B -> A has rank 1, M has rank 2 and B has rank 3\nLine 2: M I B  -> M has rank 1, I has rank 2 and B has rank 3\n\nOUTPUT\nA  1     (1)\nM 3     (2+1)\nB  6     (3+3)\n\nThe letters should be ordered lowest rank-sum first, and second alphabetically",

Of course, feel free to change as you see fit.\n\nI like the concept, it would be a fun clash. It leans a little towards the difficult side for 15 minutes IMO, but it's fairly easy to understand so almost all of the time can be spent implementing the solution.\n\nThanks for the contribution!",
