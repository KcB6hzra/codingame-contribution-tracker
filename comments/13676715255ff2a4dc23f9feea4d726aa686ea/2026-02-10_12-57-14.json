In your puzzle, I couldn't find any instances of this in the existing cases. The closest I found was a hollow rectangular snowflake in the \"All But One\" test and the \"connected-to-the-centre\" snowflake in the \"Simple Unique\" validator.\n\nIf such instances don't exist, I'm not sure whether it would be a good idea to introduce them.\n\nI also summarised the dimensions of the cases as follows:\nh = w: 17 cases\nh < w: 15 cases\nh > w: 10 cases\n(Total: 42 cases, i.e. 21 tests + 21 validators)\n\nIt's totally optional, but you could consider balancing this out a bit by adjusting existing cases or adding sky cells along the edges, without affecting the expected output. Since very few large cases contain empty edges, modifying those could be an easy fix.",

At the moment, the constraints don't explicitly forbid such inputs, so including them would still be consistent with the current specification.\n\nThat said, you could also choose to introduce a constraint that disallows this scenario.\n\nIf you do decide to include these patterns, here are two of the possible approaches:\n\n1. If you think this scenario is noteworthy enough to merit players' attention, you could introduce it through a new pair of simple cases and then incorporate similar shapes into the final 3 to 5 pairs of existing cases.\n\n2. If you feel this scenario isn't especially distinctive, you can simply integrate such shapes into the final pairs of existing cases without any special introduction.",
