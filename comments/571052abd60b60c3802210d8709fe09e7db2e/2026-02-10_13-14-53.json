    "content": "Instead of having to output the position, the output should be a string with all objects at their new position, correct? Suggestion to rephrase that in the statement and in the Output section. ('Output the position' gives me the impression that one should output the coordinates)\n\nAlso, it slightly bothers me that while at first sight I found this clash very interesting, during solving it I realized it is simply about 'remove the spaces' and 'outline left or right'. It might make it more interesting if you put one character in that also acts as wall (next to the start and end of the string). For example, the character '|' acts as wall, so that the string \n'    #|    #' with gravity -1 would result in '#    |#    '. Or even that character '|' is a wall and the start and end of the string are not walls, so that '    #|    #' with gravity -1 would result in '     |#     ' (without walls, the character just disappears).\nI have not yet thought about the coding implications of such a change (whether it would become too complicated for a clash). And, most importantly, your clash -> your choice; feel free to ignore my suggestion :-).",
