    "content": "Title\n* Please use a proper, descriptive title that accurately reflects the clash.\n\nGoal\n* The sentence \"He'll eat either food A or food B\" is misleading. In fact, Ethan may eat either type or both. Please revise the wording.\n\n* Please state that [[ca]] and [[cb]] must be non-negative integers.\n\nInput\n* Please replace \"final\" with \"target\".\n\nOutput\n* Please change \"answers\" to \"options\".\n\n* Please specify that [[ca]] and [[cb]] should be output on a separate line. Better yet, refer to the example on https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/statement , and use a structure like this for clarity:\n\nIf Ethan can reach the target [[T]]:\n<<Line 1>>: {{YES}}\n<<Line 2>>: Two space-separated integers [[ca]] and [[cb]], representing (…followed by more description)\n\nOtherwise:\n<<Line 1>>: {{NO}}\n\nGame modes\n* The requirement may be difficult to infer in Reverse mode. Consider disabling this mode.\n\nCases\n* Please use meaningful and relevant titles for all test cases. Avoid names such as \"HEHEHEHA\".\n\n* Please remove the trailing newlines from both the input and the output of every case.\n\n* Each test and its validator should cover the same scenario. Please update the cases as follows:\n\n  • Swap Validator 1 with Test 3\n\n  • Revise Test 4 so that its value of T is closer in magnitude to Validator 4, while remaining within the constraints. Also ensure that ca > 0 and cb > 0.\n\n* Please create a new pair of cases where a > 100, b > 100, T > 100, ca = 0 and cb > 0.\n\nThanks.",
