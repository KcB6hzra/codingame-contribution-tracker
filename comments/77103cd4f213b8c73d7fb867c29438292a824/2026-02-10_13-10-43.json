I don't think that you can get rid of the example... that's all I'm saying.\nHowever I could be wrong.\n\nAlso, the author has already stated that the target consists of red and white \"SQUARES\" stacked onto each other, this would mean that it is a rectangular target. This means that your comment is slightly obvious... right? \n\nHowever I could be wrong again...\n\nYours apologetically, Code-Parser.",
