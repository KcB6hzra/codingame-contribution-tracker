In the description of \"Output\" you say: \"You must output the int found at index N\". As you allow N to be 1, it is also possible, that the desired output is '.', which is not an int value.",

The constraints allow this but the statement says we should output an int, however the answer would be \".\" I suppose.\n\"output the int in the range of 0 to 10\" may be confusing, it should be specified 10 is excluded. Better yet just say \"digit\".\n\"You must output the int found at indice x.\" shouldn't it be index N?\n-Finally we already have a lot a puzzles based on prime numbers. While I don't think this alone is a reason for rejection, some people might.",
