    "content": "Your tests/validators aren't good enough for this to be allowed in Reverse mode currently.\n\nI just got this in a Reverse clash and noticed that I could get 100% on tests just by counting the number of opening and closing brackets of each type and making sure that they were equal, ignoring whether the opening and closing was done correctly e.g. \")({}][\" would be ok.\n\nThe only test/validator that ensures clashers get tested for this is the final validator \"Wrong Json bis.\", which means that I ended up getting 75% after submitting.\n\nYou really need to add more tests/validators showing that the order matters, otherwise there's always temptation in a timed clash to submit the fastest code that gets you 100% on the tests, especially in Reverse mode.",
