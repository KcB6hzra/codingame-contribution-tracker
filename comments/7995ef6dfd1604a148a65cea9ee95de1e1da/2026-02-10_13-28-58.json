There are better versions of this topic elsewhere as told by eulerscheZahl, because containing more cities, but it may be interesting to have it here as well, because it will be visible for more developers and be an opportunity for more begginer developers to have an \"easier\" version to train. I tried it and I like the visuals showing the best path we found.",

    "content": "❌ Rejected the contribution.\nComment: CodinGame indeed lacks a TSP problem as far as I know. But I have doubts that an optimization problem is the right way.\nThere are highly optimized solvers like concorde freely available for offline solving.\nhttps://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html - on their website they claim to handle 85900 cities - and from my own experiences with it (finding a Hamilton path in over 10k nodes) it's extremely fast and not even that hard to use.\nWith such tooling I predict lots of optimal solutions on the leaderboard.\nI suggest moving it to the puzzle section and demanding a certain level of optimization to pass the testcase, then I'd gladly approve.\n\nHow is the distance defined? Euclidean?\n\n\nEdit: I inserted test 5 (the first with 300 nodes) into an online solver: https://neos-server.org/neos/jobs/11590000/11599531.html\nOptimal Solution: 17112.00 (we could argue about the rounding but I could simply multiply every input number by a large factor)\nTotal Running Time: 2.64 (seconds)\n\nAnd hardcoded on CG: https://i.imgur.com/FudWwES.png",
