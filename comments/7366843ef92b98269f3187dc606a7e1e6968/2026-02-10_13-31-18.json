One could also require only one output per test, then one would not have to code / call a function within the loop.\n\n\nEdit: Tested the challenge again, much better now --> approved :)",

    "content": "A little tricky for 15 min but doable. A few things that were confusing to me: \n- \"A player's hand is the best 5 card-combination from the 7 card input.\" Given that a Full House or Quads are a better hand that a straight, the best 5 card-combination out of the 7 card input may not contain a straight, even if there is a 5 card-combination in the 7 cards that contains a straight. The test cases confirm that this is not how it's meant, though the description could be clearer. \n- In Python, the default code may be a bit misleading. \"for hand in input.split()\" should be \"for card in input.split()\". Also, I fail to imagine a good implementation that would use the second for-loop, so that might also be obsolete. \n\nDespite that, nicely done, it was a fun problem to solve!",
