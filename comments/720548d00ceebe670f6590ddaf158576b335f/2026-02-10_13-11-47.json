    "content": "The provided task description appears to be clear and well-structured. However, one potential aspect that might be considered a \"loophole\" or an area for clarification is the exact definition of the input format. The task mentions reading an integer N followed by pairs of \"folder-subfolder\" or \"grandparent-grandchild\" relationships, but it doesn't specify how these relationships should be represented in the input.\n\nFor example, it's not explicitly stated whether each pair should be on a separate line, separated by spaces, or if there should be any delimiters or separators between pairs.\n\nAdding a clear description of the expected input format would make the task even more precise and prevent potential confusion for those attempting to solve it.",
