    "content": "The reverse mode is currently really hard to figure out. The fact that the list is sorted at the end makes it even more confusing, because it hides the connection between input and output. Since the order is completely changed, it's hard to guess what operation was applied to each element.\nAlso, most of the inputs are in ascending order, which makes you think at first that the rule is just about reversing the list. That throws you off the actual logic. On top of that, many of the test cases only use odd or even numbers, which doesn’t help in figuring out the parity-based transformation.\nI even tested it by giving both the visible and validator test cases to ChatGPT-4o, and it didn’t find the correct logic either. That’s a sign that the current setup really hides the rule too well.\nIt would be clearer if there were more simple test cases with a mix of even and odd numbers in a random order. That way, the pattern would be easier to spot without being misled by the structure.\nFor the two other modes, the problem is totally fine and doable in less than 5 minutes, so no problem there.",
