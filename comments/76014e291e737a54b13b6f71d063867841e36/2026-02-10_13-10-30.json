I think there would be nice aspects for an Easy puzzle (such as finding all sets in 12 given cards, or finding a thirteenth card that would get the most possible sets with 12 given cards, or predicting who wins out of two players that each follow a unique fixed strategy, ...).\nSorry, your nice contribution got me brainstorming.",

If you have problems with the \"given 2 cards\" part, then say it, because you only spoke about the 12 cards part.\n\nEDIT: Oh I get what you mean. You thought that it's 12 values because I wrote 3 values for 4 attributes (3 * 4 = 12). No, I didn't write out twelve cards, I wrote 12 values and 3 cards in the example. If you find an image, you should clearly see that there are 12 cards layed out. I hope this answers your question!",
