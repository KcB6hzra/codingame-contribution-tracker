    "content": "I'm really having trouble understanding the nuts and bolts here. I think I got the gist, though.\n\nWhen I receive the seven depots as input, in what order are they? For the first puzzle, I get the lower left first, then the upper-right, then the left, then the lower-right, etc. I created a solution for that example, but for the next example, it seems that the depots must be coming in a different order? This gets really confusing; perhaps you can do this:\n\nNumber the depots top left = 0, top right = 1, left = 2, etc. and always pass the depots in order? So, always pass the sides of depot 0 first, then depot 1, then depot 2, etc.\n\nIf I'm understanding the puzzle correctly, this should be fine and will improve the comprehensibility of the puzzle greatly. If this defeats the point of the puzzle, then I obviously don't understand the point of the puzzle.\n\nCheers!",

I kinda dislike wording that up in a statement that's complex enough already.\n\nSo to bring it back to your initial answer, I wouldn't like to get down to option (2), I'd prefer some variation of (1). I've expressed two ways out. My implementation starts with the center, so it doesn't have any better incentive to output the lexicographically first solution only instead of the lexicographically sorted entire set, so those two (your 1 and my A) are equivalent in my view, difficulty-wise, but let's recognize they exist separately.\n\nNo strong opinions on which is the best, they're all warty in their own way.",

The hexagon sequence must be printed left-to-right, top-to-bottom. The first hexagon in the input is the top left, and the last is the bottom right. After each index, the program must print the letter of the wall to the right. (see source for formatting-enhanced presentation)",
