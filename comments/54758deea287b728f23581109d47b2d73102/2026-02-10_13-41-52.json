You can try to task something like adding numbers and such, but if you want to deepen the complexity you can go up to a proper LP solver like done at e.g. https://github.com/coin-or/Clp\n\nI have no idea how to extend it with having still a nice problem. So in end I would need to come up with something completely different. I also looked a bit more into the other problem and it seems really different to what I am proposing. I think you should ignore my solution and try to solve both of them.\n\nMine is a rather easy graph problem (is graph cylic or acylic) using inequalities to make it such that people don't just google an algorithm. His is about logic where you also use implications.\n\nI don't know what to argue else. I don't have an easy way to make my problem different. If this problem is not good enough, just decline it.",
