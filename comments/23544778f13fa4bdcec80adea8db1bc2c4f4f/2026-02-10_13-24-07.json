Would like to see that changed before approval.\n\nBesides that, pretty nice puzzle. It's easy to understand what to do and the test cases are well designed.\n\nSuggestions:\n- Format the statement better.\n----- Samples of [[recipe]] and their outputs should be written as constants instead of enclosing them in quotation marks.\n----- Same goes for the abbreviations; they should be written as constants instead of in boldface.\n- Change the constraint of [[recipe]]: The shortest valid length of [[recipe]] is 5 (1# nl).",

    "content": "Thank you for the feedback.\nYes, I'm glad you noticed that.\n\nI spent a lot of time trying to figure out the absolute shortest way to do notation in the \"recipe\".\nAt one point I had a symbol like \n10=3\nto indicate to type \"3\" 10 times but then that caused a problem decoding an image when actual \"=\" symbols were in the image itself.\n\nEventually I realized you don't need that because yes by definition, a character is 1 character (not sure the technical way to say that).\nSo if a chunk is only digits (such as 25 or 103), you know that the last character is the character and all the ones to the left are \"how many\".\nIn other words, if a chunk is only digits then the pattern is xy or xxy or xxxy or xxxxy etc where y is character and x is the \"how many\"\n\nTo address your specific example:\nThe recipe to print \"36\" 10 times (aka to print \"36363636363636363636\")\nis\n13 16 13 16 13 16 13 16 13 16 13 16 13 16 13 16 13 16 13 16\n\nI kind of like that this \"complication\" is part of it.  In my opinion, that makes it qualify more as a \"Classic Puzzle\" than a \"Clash\"",

It's only to ensure that the players don't hardcode the solution\" and I think my validators do that.  No?\n\nBut I have actually written my own private program to translate images into recipes, so doing 4 more won't be hard, and so I will probably go ahead and do that. :)\n\nUPDATE : Done :)\nUPDATE: I added a bunch more tests/validators",
