    "content": "General\n* It's not fair if Python has a specific function to answer the problem while other programming languages do not. Having said that, please at least let players who don't know `pow` in Python or players of other programming languages have a chance to pass the clash by simple brute-forcing. Hence, I suggest to reduce the upper bound of [[m]] to make that possible.\n\nInput\n* Please delete \"(positive or not)\" (not sure what you are trying to say here).\n\nGame modes\n* Suggest to disable Reverse mode as it may be too difficult to guess the requirement.\n\nCases\n* Each pair of test and validator should be similar but *not the same*. For this clash, please revise the cases so that the magnitude of the input is similar for each pair (to achieve similarity).\n\n* Please balance the magnitude of input among the cases (currently you have either very small inputs or very large inputs - very extreme). So, together with the above point, you may try:\n\nTest 1 and Validator 1: 1 ≤ x, m ≤ 9\nTest 2 and Validator 2: 10 ≤ x, m ≤ 99\nTest 3 and Validator 3: 100 ≤ x, m ≤ 999\nTest 4 and Validator 4: 1000 ≤ x, m ≤ 9999\nAnd so on if you want more than 4 pairs of cases.\n\nThanks.",
