This could be resolved by either making sure all 10 colours are used in the examples section (currently only 4 are), and/or perhaps if instead of colours you used something like letters ABCDEFGHIJ, something in increasing order making it easier for the observer to come up with a mapping to numbers (in my example, A=0, J=9 - this way people might spot the pattern and know how to deal with all of the letters (which were previously colours). Apologies if more than 1 example will already be included in the statement section and my IDE experience is not relevant.",
