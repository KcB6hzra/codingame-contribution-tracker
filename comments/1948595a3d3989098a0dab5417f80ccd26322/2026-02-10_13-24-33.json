Letters are <<increasing>> if one letter is followed by another letter which appears later in the alphabet\n\nWhen a letter is part of a decreasing sequence and an increasing sequence at the same time, it is deemed to belong to the earlier sequence, e.g. acedb consists of an increasing sequence of length 3 and a decreasing sequence of length 2.\n\nRepeating letters are included in the same sequence as if it is just one letter, but we still count all of them, e.g. bbba is a decreasing sequence of length 4, while abb is an increasing sequence of length 3.\n\nCharacters that are not letters should be ignored. Letter case is irrelevant.\n\nThe lengths should be separated by '-' (minus) and output in a single line, e.g. the output for acedb is 3-2.\n\n\nThanks.",
