    "content": "Goal section\n* As it is difficult to do separate comments I will just write the suggested rewording here for your consideration:\n\nThe problem is to find the extra letters in the figure.\n\nYou are given a <<figure>> of [[n]] rows and [[n]] columns. The figure consists of letters, {{#}} and {{.}}.\nYou are also given a <<string>> [[s]] of the letters that are allowed in the figure.\n\nThe rules are:\n1. Some letters may appear more than once in the <<figure>>.\n2. Some letters may appear more than once in [[s]].\n3. {{#}} and {{.}} in the <<figure>> should be ignored.\n4. The number of occurrences of each letter in [[s]] should be the same as that in the <<figure>>. For example, if {{A}} appears {{3}} times in [[s]], then {{A}} should also appear exactly {{3}} times in the <<figure>>.\n5. If all occurrences match, output {{Correct}}.\n6. If the <<figure>> shows more letters than [[s]], output {{Incorrect}} followed by a space and all the extra letters sorted in alphabetical order, e.g. {{Incorrect AABZ}}.\n\n* You may want to use `monospace text` for the figures in the examples.\n\nInput section\n* A brief description is still required for each variable in this section. (Goal section explains them in a more detailed and cohesive manner.) Please check my comment on your other contribution \"Filling in the holes\" for more details.\n\nConstraints section\n* Please remove the third constraint if you adopt my reworded Goal section statement above.\n\nThanks.\n\nBy the way, the clash could be evolved to another cool idea like \"Your team is planning a marathon event and marking on a map the locations where the runners must reach. The final list of locations has been confirmed after several changes, and now you are checking whether the locations marked on the map are correct.\" :)",

It's type of variable + variable + description.\nAnd I think the marathon idea is really good, but unfortunately, I am not familiar with marathon events, so I didn't understand the marathon explanation at the end. however, I would like to write something that includes the story of the problem statement from now on.(*'ω'*)",

It always make me happy to hear that you have learned something :D\n\n2 more follow-up comments:\n\nInput section\n* Line 2 description may be changed as:\nA string [[s]] for the characters that are allowed in the figure.\n\n* Suggest to swap the order of line 1 and line 2 so that the logic flows more smoothly (usually the number of lines is mentioned immediately before those lines. In your version, the logic flow is interrupted by [[s]] inserted between [[n]] and the [[n]] lines.\n\nMore work is involved for the second point, so if you don't want to change it, it's fine.\n\nWhat I mean by \"more work\": In addition to changing the Input section, all the test cases, the stub generator, and your solution have to be updated too. While tedious it is still not a lot I hope :P",
