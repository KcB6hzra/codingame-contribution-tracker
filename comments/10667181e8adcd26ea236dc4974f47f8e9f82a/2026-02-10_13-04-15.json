    "content": "In spoken language, \"between\" can be either inclusive or exclusive. For instance, \"number between 1 and 3\" is very common and clearly inclusive, while \"stop between home and work\" is clearly exclusive. I don't doubt that, in technical contexts, it's more typically exclusive, because people tend to use more discretion in such contexts, and not so much in spoken language. It's the same sort of ambiguity with \"if\" and \"must\" and many other natural language constructs.\n\nWhat should trigger a heightened awareness in this problem is the use of zero as the starting point. The range is akin to a percentage, which is by default inclusive in the same sense that a probability being naturally bound between 0 and 1 doesn't need further clarification. However, the use of zero in a computing context raises another possibility that doesn't occur naturally in language: 0 inclusive and 100 exclusive. So I definitely classify this particular phrasing as underspecified, and felt justified in approving the clash as unambiguous because it is specified in the constraints.\n\nIf after this explanation you feel that the phrasing is misspecified or even just misleading, then I will value that intuition and encourage you to say as much. My comment above follows the line of thinking that these sorts of questions come up in real life and shouldn't always be scrubbed if deliberated and found within reason. It may annoy someone to have to change their bounds, and they may even protest temporarily, but they may have also learned something, and learning is not often a joyful process.",
