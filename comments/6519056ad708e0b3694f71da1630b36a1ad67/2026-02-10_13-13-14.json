    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: I think making the input two separate lists and adding a provision for empty lists elevates this to a suitable Clash puzzle. The two lists would make this a bit more of a challenge as a Reverse, but still should be solvable. I was able to code up a Ruby solution in about a minute. Coders using C will be at a disadvantage for both Timed and Shortest because the syntax of the qsort function is a bit arcane and requires a comparator, but them's the breaks.",
