    "content": "I really liked this puzzle and also learned something new. \nI think the statement needs to be improved though,\n\n1.  Part 1 is really hard to understand without looking at the links. It says, that you need to find the two smallest frequencies, but you really need to find the two trees with smallest values. Maybe state in the beginning that you start with n trees where each tree corresponds to one char and has a value of the frequency of this char. I think an expample with more steps, where two leaves are joined together more than once, like ' 5 2 2 3 6',  would make the algorithm also clearer.\n2. In 'Part 2' the value of d is '11', but should be '10'\n3. The input section states that the list of frequency values is ordered, but its not. (or ordered by what?)\n\nIn the stub you could also use 'loopline n wi:int' instead of 'read weight:string(10000)' to make it more convenient to read the input.",

It's not a word but a line. And maybe you can use int array ?\n\n2. In your “aabacdad” example, the binary code could be switch for 'b' and 'c'. In Huffman coding you build a table for a specific input that is use later for decoding. In case of equal frequency you make a choice that lead to different valid table.\nYou have to state a specific ordering when frequency is the same. Frequency as input is maybe not enough... a String input would be more appropriate ?! We could sort by character in case of equal frequency. But you have to think about it... how do we choose in this case :\ndcbaa -> b(1) c(1) d(1) a(2)\n(bc) then (ad) or (da) (character sorting or frequency sorting)...",

    "content": "The point is that (cause of me !!) it's possible now to solve it without a tree by playing with a list and a counter... So the puzzle is now more simple.\nThe Huffman code is about building a tree but here error prone cause of the choice we can make.\nSo instead of asking for the whole table you can ask for :\n\n1. the final size after compression\nExample with 4 1 1 2  -> a = 0, b = 110, c = 111, d = 11\nThe size is then 4 * 1 + 1 * 3 + 1 * 3 + 2 * 2 = 14 bits.\nYou keep an equivalent difficulty as the first version as we have to manage the tree to keep track of each length (even if i think we can still turn around !!). You ensure in a way that the table we build is correct by finding the optimal solution no matter we choose 0 for the left or the right or we keep these two minimum whatever their positions in the queue or list or... and this is a rather relevant question for the puzzle, at least i think.\n\n2. how much space in bits you win after compression\nExample with 4 1 1 2 -> 8 * 8 - 14 = 70 bits\nThis question is maybe more relevant but needs maybe to change the N constraints to justify that  a char occupy 8 bits with your test case.\n\n\nNow the Test 5 is false. I use the N value and it's not 1001 but 1000 and frequencies are on two lines so your solution do not read the second. I think that you just duplicate the line by mistake ?!\n\nI read and check the thing to approve your puzzle and the stubs generator is not valid at least for C, Objective C and PHP as the generation produce :\n    char weight[1025];\n    fgets(weight, 1025, stdin);\nThe whole line will not be read for some test case...",
