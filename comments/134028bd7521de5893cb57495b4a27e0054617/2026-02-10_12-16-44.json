    "content": "Introduction\n* (Level 3 statement) Please change \"opponent'’'s territory\" to \"opponent's territory\".\n\nRules - Map\n* Consider changing \"Map\" to \"Board\".\n\n* Consider changing \"skirmish\" to \"match\" (which is used in the \"Beehives\" section).\n\n* Board square type 3: The description feels contradictory. It says the board can contain rock squares, but also that rocks do not appear inside the board. If the intention is that rock squares appear on the edges only, consider simplifying the last two sentences (\"The board is always surrounded by rock squares. Rocks do not appear inside the board.\") as:\n\nAll edge squares of the board are rock squares, and non-edge squares are never rock squares.\n\nRules - Player Territories\n* Strictly speaking, the player outputs coordinates only, not a direction. Consider revising \"then the best square moving in the given direction will be automatically calculated - and the expansion attempt will be performed on it\" to:\n\nin which case the expansion attempt will be performed on the best square between your territory and the chosen square.\n\n(Or adjust the wording in another way that avoids mentioning a \"given direction\".)\n\n* (Level 2 statement) These sentences appear twice:\n\n  • You can expand the territory by occupying squares adjacent to the area you already own.\n  \n  • You can only occupy neutral squares.\n\nRules - square Levels\n* Please change \"square\" to \"Square\" in the section heading.\n\n* Consider adding the takeover neighbourhood clarification (as per @darkhorse64's comment) to the statement.\n\nRules - Bees\n* Please change \"one bee on\" to \"one bee spawns on\" (twice).\n\nInput in Each Turn\n* Please delete \"Next\".\n\n* Please change \"<var>171</var>\" to \"<const>171</const>\".\n\n* Consider changing \"map\" to \"board\".\n\n* Please change \"square position on the x-coordinate\" to \"the x-coordinate of the square\".\n\n* Please change \"square position on the y-coordinate\" to \"the y-coordinate of the square\".\n\nOutput\n* The text inconsistently switches between \"we\"/\"our\"/\"us\" and \"you\"/\"your\".\n\nStub\n* Please change \"square position on the x-coordinate\" to \"the x-coordinate of the square\".\n\n* Please change \"square position on the y-coordinate\" to \"the y-coordinate of the square\".\n\nThanks.",
