I have looked through your solution. As far as I understand your code the Perm-class does produce every permutation. There is no optimization done to exclude some permutations. So it is essentially a brute-force approach? Also In the calc-method I can't find anything which looks like an optimizing trick.  Does it all come down to the difference in speed between java and python or do I miss something?",
