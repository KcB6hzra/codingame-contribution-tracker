Department has a budget problem and they can afford only one letter so they need to cut all others. They know letters' popularity rates but they still want to know how different sentences would look.\nSo, you're given a sentence and n lines. In each line, there is a letter and its popularity rate.\nFor each given letter you need to output how the sentence would look if all other letters were replaced with whitespaces. And you need to output it in ascending letter popularity order.\n`\nYou can replace the popularity rate with a priority.\nThe idea is to tie ordering up to rate/priority so it's more intuitive.

It took me a long time to realise that we aren't outputting each line in correspondence with the input (which would make this a straight-forward and perfect difficulty clash), but that you are asking us to solve each line and then output them in an order specified by the integers given with each line...\n\nI feel the ordering is an unnecessary complication that adds nothing to the challenge except frustration for people trying to solve it. I like the core puzzle, but I recommend removing the ordering part or otherwise making it MUCH more clear in the description (perhaps by changing the hello example to \"o 3\", \"e 1\", \"h 0\", \"l 2\" as input).",
