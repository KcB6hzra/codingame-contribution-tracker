If more than one emergency alarm goes off, then you go to the nearest emergency alarm.\n\nEXAMPLE\nInput\n0 0\n3\n3 4 Emergency\n4 2 Alarm\n1 1\n\nOutput\n4.5\"\n-----------------------------\nmy reaction was : \"What ? what's that 4.5 value ? it's not even an alarm coordinate ?!\"\n\nThe first part of the text seems to mean \"find the next alarm to go to\" and reality is \"find distance to the next alarm to go to\"\n\n\n\n\nAll of that was written in Input and Ouput parts, but when you first read statement, it's not clear",
