    "content": "Great puzzle! For me, learning Euclid's algorithm was an impactful moment in my education that I will probably never forget and your puzzle is a nice complement to that learning process.\n\nMay I have your permission to do some minor grammatical and formatting edits? I will not change any of your test cases or the overall structure of your puzzle. It is well done as is. I find it is easier to ask permission for minor edits than to write the suggestions all out and go back and forth. You can take a snapshot and veto anything I change if you wish. i.e. A couple of capitalization mistakes, using \"greatest common divisor\" alongside the first use of \"GCD\" instead of the third use of \"GCD\", etc.\n\nI do have one suggestion that is purely aesthetic. How about naming your test cases according to the division being done. i.e. Instead of \"Test 1\", the name could be \"25 / 3\". Obviously, that is purely superficial, but you have a great puzzle and I'd like to see it present visually as well as possible!",
