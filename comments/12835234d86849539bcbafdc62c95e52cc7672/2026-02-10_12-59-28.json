This works because none of the metals is substring of a nonmetal. (\"H\" is substring of \"He\", but H and He are both nonmetals)",

    "content": "Cases\n* There are too few test cases compared to the long lists of metals and nonmetals. While the lists shouldn't be so short that hardcoding becomes viable, but they also shouldn't be excessively long if only a handful of elements are actually being tested.\n\n* It feels odd in \"shortest\" mode for a similar reason. The goal is to golf the solution, yet including the full list of elements is practically mandatory, leaving less room for clever code-shortening tricks.\n\nI'm not saying you should disable shortest mode, but this is definitely something to keep in mind when designing the cases and selecting elements to include in the lists.\n\n* In summary, shorten both lists to a reasonable length (e.g. 10 to 15 elements in each list). Try to include elements which look similar, e.g. H and He, C, Cl, Ca and Cu.\n\n* Please change the cases as follows, and add new ones as well:\n\n  • Test 4: Please change \"Fr I\" to \"I Fr\".\n  \n  • Validator 4: Please change the input so that [[e1]] is a nonmetal and [[e2]] is a metal.\n  \n  • Test 5 and Validator 5: Covalent.\n  \n  • Test 6 and Validator 6: Metallic.\n\nStub generator\n* Please shorten the lists.\n\n* Again missing something.\n\nThanks.",
