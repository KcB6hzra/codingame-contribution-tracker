    "content": "Hey! A few concerns, if you will:\n- The problem statement needs to specify how we should be rounding the progress. To illustrate it simply, let's say the bar was 10 items long and the progress was 0.45. Should this be \"XXXX------\" or \"XXXXX-----\"? Should we be rounding down, up, or in between?\n- I'm wondering why you constrained progress from being equal to 0 or 1?\n- \"How many characters L the bar should use Not always its length\" Would find a better way to describe this \"character\". A string with L characters has a length of L, always. The confusion is where you describe \"[]\" as one *character* as an example, but it's confusing to describe it as a \"character\" even though it includes 2 characters. How do we know which one you mean when you say \"character\"?",
