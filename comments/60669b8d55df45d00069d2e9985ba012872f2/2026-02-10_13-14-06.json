'Increasing from top to bottom and then left to right' for the example case would imply output 3, not 2. Later cases indeed require preference top/bottom over left/right (eg Assymetrical compartments, unaligned compartments), but 'Ring at the edge' weirdly follows left-right and then top-bottom again.",
