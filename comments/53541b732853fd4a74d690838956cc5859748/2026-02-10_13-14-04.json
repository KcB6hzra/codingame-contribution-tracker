I think my solution works because I recreate a range and check which of those numbers is not in the input, and then simply take the first missing (assuming all others are there anyway). For test 4 the XX was before the mistake, so that one was the first one missing from the range. So I passed a bit luckily - if XX would be after the mistake my code would have failed. I am glad your code did fail --> thanks for finding the mistake!\nI corrected the mistake.",

I'll pull it back in WIP until I added cases to let a person fail either both tests&validators or succeed in all.\nI agree it is on the long side - I was curious how the community would think about it. I did deliberately put the XX in so that it is 'simply' a matter of getting and sorting all numbers, finding the missing one, and putting it at position XX. I think that such awareness + coding should be possible in 5 minutes for the faster coders.",
