    "content": "I just got this in a Reverse clash and at first thought it was way too hard just looking at it, it just seemed like too many things were happening at once and it was going to be too complex to code.\n\nThen I just started working on it and realised it's all about taking rows as arrays of PAIRS of characters and then rotating those. Knowing rotation is just transposing rows to columns along with some reversal of the rows/columns makes it then very easy to actually solve this (especially in Ruby where \".transpose\" is available).\n\nIn the end it only took a bit over 4 minutes. :) Nice clash. The test cases really help with understanding it, too. Unfortunately everyone else in my clash got 0% though (3/4, 2 of them were bots).",
