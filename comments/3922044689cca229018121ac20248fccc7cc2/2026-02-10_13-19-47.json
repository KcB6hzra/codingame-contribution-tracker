But if I stack the cubes such that: 2 at the bottom, 1 at the middle and 3 at the top, then the free surface is 4*6-4-1+1*6-1-1+9*6-1 = 76 > 73.\n\nPlease update your solution such as all the combinations are tried to find the maximum free surface area. Otherwise, add a statement that the cubes can only be stacked bottom in ascending order.",

    "content": "Ohh, actually I like this.  It's tricker than it seems upon first glance.  \nI think it's clear; but a player (me) might not realize for example when a 3-size cube is stacked above a 2-size cube, there is UNDER-surface that needs to be counted too.  \nThat's great that I had to realize that part-way into the puzzle.  \n\nI really like it, and will come back and solve further later.  Good job!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nUPDATE: I have now solved it, and will give approval.  Great.  A pleasure.\n\nI few very minor things:\n~I think \"ie.\" should be \"i.e.\"\n~You might (or might not) want to explicitly mention that Bill can stack a larger cube on top of a smaller cube.  It was kinda fun having to make that discovery on my own, but some people might be frustrated with that.  I don't feel strongly one way or the other; just consider it.",
