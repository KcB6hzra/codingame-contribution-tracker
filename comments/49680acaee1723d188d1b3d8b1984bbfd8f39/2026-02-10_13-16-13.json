I've just added a cover picture, good reminder.\n\nOn editing approved contributions: apparently editing the cover picture does not change it's approval stage. However, for one of my clashes ('Quick, find a toilet') I got the feedback that there is a specific case with 100% test score but 25% validator score - do you know what happens to an approved clash if test/validator cases are modified?",

So technically speaking there won't be any harmful side effects.\n\nThe only thing about editing a clash (or a puzzle for that matter) is whether it's respecting the original commenters and approvers in doing so. Usually editing should be avoided, but it's ok with good and sufficient justification. In the case of 'Quick, find a toilet', I think it's justified.",
