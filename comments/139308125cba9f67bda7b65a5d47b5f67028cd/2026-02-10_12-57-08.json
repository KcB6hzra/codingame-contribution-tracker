    "content": "Good, the cases look more robust now!\n\nIt's more difficult for me to go through the cases by hand now, so we may have to wait for reviewers who attempt your puzzle to see if they find anything else. For my part, I've gone through Test/Validator 6 by hand. Please correct me if my understanding is off.\n\n* Test 6: Wheel Hub Blocked: Valid paths include 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 and 0 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3, which have equal length. To distinguish these, I would suggest changing [[E]] to 4, but then the shortest valid path becomes length 2, which is the same as the invalid path via node 6. I would therefore further suggest modifying the input so that the central node is #7, the two valid paths are 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and 0 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4, and the invalid path becomes 0 -> 7 -> 4.\n\n* Validator 6: We use the same logic here, but we can simply change [[E]] to 6 (and the expected output) to achieve the desired effect.\n\n* Apply similar logic to the other cases: try to ensure that different paths within a case have different lengths. This helps verify that a solution finds the correct path rather than another path of equal length.\n\n* Do any cases cover the scenario where all fuses blow at the same time: at the final step? If not, consider creating a pair of cases for this if possible. At the same time, it may be best not to have too many IMPOSSIBLE cases. You could either merge some impossible paths into possible cases (which still ensuring that the solver evaluates the impossible paths), or add additional pairs of cases (e.g. with many valid paths to choose from) so that the overall proportion of impossible cases remains less than half.\n\nThanks again.",

Now test stats are like\n- IMPOSSIBLE: 2/11 = 18%\n- Single valid path: 2/9 = 22% (Tests 1, 11)\n- Multiple valid paths: 7/9 = 78%\n- Naive BFS correct: 3/11 = 27% (Tests 1, 2, 8)\n- Max N: 100\n- Max M: 100\n\nAlso, added test with maximal N and M values.\n\nJust a list of the key test features:\n1. Simple Path - Basic test, algorithm works normally\n2. Disconnected - Edge case: no path at all\n3. Triangle + Alt - Shortest path (T=1) burns, two alternative paths\n4. Hexagon Diagonal - Diagonal blocked, two perimeter paths\n5. Mid-failure Bypass - Main path breaks mid-way, two bypasses available\n6. Hub Blocked - Central hub unusable, must go around edge (2 paths)\n7. Shortcut + Alt - Short path blocked, two long paths valid\n8. Grid Traversal - Grid navigation, multiple equivalent paths\n9. Fuses at Final Step - ALL paths burn exactly at arrival\n10. Circle Complete - Dense graph (M=80), must use perimeter\n11. Hamiltonian 10x10 - Max constraints (N=100, M=100), snake path",

    "content": "Well done. That's a fairly comprehensive set of test cases. Here are my comments on the latest version:\n\nConstraints\n* Please add the following constraint:\nEvery node is connected to at least one other node.\n\nCases\n* Test 8: Nodes 3 and 6 are missing. Please add wires connecting these nodes.\n\n* For testing purpose, I slightly modified the example in the Goal section so that the input is:\n3 2\n0 2\n0 1 2\n1 2 1\n\nI'd expect the answer to be 2, but your solution code outputs IMPOSSIBLE. Have I misunderstood anything?\n\n* Assuming my understanding is correct, I'd suggest replacing the last test and the last validator with cases generated by this code, where [[S]] ≠ 0 and the wires along valid paths are in randomised order: https://pastebin.com/n2UsACuy\n\nThanks.",

It is was a bug in my solution (extra +1) and I missed the edge case (facepalm). Fixed it now and updated the tests accordingly.\n\n> * Assuming my understanding is correct, I'd suggest replacing the last test ...\nAdded a new test but had to change the proposed generator a little: made generation predictable (by providing a seed) and made N configurable. Also, with N=100, it was generating M>100 which is against the constraints. So I reduced it to 96 (thasuch an N gives M==100).",
