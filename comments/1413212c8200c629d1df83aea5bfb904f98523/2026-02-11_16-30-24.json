    "content": "# Review of Your \"ChronoRail — Earliest Arrival\" Puzzle\n\nThis is a sophisticated graph/scheduling puzzle! Here's my detailed feedback:\n\n## ✅ Strengths\n\n1. **Excellent problem statement** - Very clear explanation of the mechanics\n2. **Great example** - The track input example with `1 2 5 1010` is perfect for understanding\n3. **Well-designed constraints** - P ≤ 60 is clever (allows state-space reduction)\n4. **Performance note included** - Good warning about naive solutions\n5. **Comprehensive test coverage** - Multiple paths, impossible cases, cycles, scheduling conflicts\n6. **Appropriate difficulty** - Definitely \"Hard\" level\n\n## 🔧 Issues to Fix\n\n### 1. **Test Case 7 Output Verification**\nLet me trace through Test 7 to verify the answer of `7`:\n- Path `1→5→6→12`: depart 1 at t=1, arrive 5 at t=3, depart at t=4, arrive 6 at t=6, depart at t=5... wait, this doesn't work.\n- Path `1→3→4→12`: depart 1 at t=0, arrive 3 at t=1, wait until t=2, depart at t=2, arrive 4 at t=5, wait until t=4... \n\nThe schedule indexing might be confusing. Please double-check that all test case answers are correct.\n\n### 2. **Clarify 0-based vs 1-based Indexing**\nYou state:\n> A track may be departed at time t if and only if the digit of s at index (t mod P) equals 1 (0-based index).\n\nThis is clear, but the example could reinforce it:\n> For schedule `1010` with P=4: index 0→'1', index 1→'0', index 2→'1', index 3→'0'\n\n### 3. **Edge Case: Starting Station Already Target**\nWhat if N=1? The constraints say N ≥ 2, so this is fine, but consider mentioning it.\n\n### 4. **Edge Case: Multiple Tracks Between Same Stations**\nTest 5 has this (multiple 1→2 tracks), which is good! But explicitly stating \"multiple tracks between the same pair of stations are allowed\" would help.\n\n### 5. **Constraint on Schedule Having At Least One '1'**\nWhat if a schedule is all zeros (e.g., `0000`)? Test 4 has `000` which makes the track unusable. This is valid, but consider adding:\n> Note: A track with an all-zero schedule can never be used.\n\n### 6. **Missing Large-Scale Stress Test**\nYour constraints allow N=20000, M=50000, but your largest test (Validator 7) only has N=25, M=35. Consider adding:\n```\nStress Test:\nN=10000 M=40000 P=60\n[large generated input]\n```\n\nThis ensures solutions handle the full constraint range.\n\n## 💡 Algorithm Hint (for your solution)\n\nThe key insight is that state = (station, time mod P) since schedules repeat with period P.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m, p = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    # Build adjacency list: adj[u] = [(v, d, schedule), ...]\n    adj = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(m):\n        parts = input().split()\n        u, v, d = int(parts[0]), int(parts[1]), int(parts[2])\n        s = parts[3]\n        adj[u].append((v, d, s))\n    \n    # State: (time, station)\n    # Key insight: only need to track (station, time % P) for visited\n    # But actual time matters for the answer\n    \n    # Dijkstra with state (statio",
