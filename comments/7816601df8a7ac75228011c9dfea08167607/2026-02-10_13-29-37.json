    "content": "While the coding part of this is very easy, I enjoyed this clash because it gave a quick review of Kepler's third law.  I personally don't think the subject is too complicated, as the bold text transcribes to the equation you need.  It is more of a math word problem more than a coding problem, but I would claim that being able to interpret and understand basic math and physics formulas is an important skill to acquire for game programming.",

Please keep in mind that users of CG are usaully not native speakers. So I believe this is too dificult for a clash of code puzle.\nYou could try it as a classical puzzle, or you make a much easier and have the formula given in the text.",

I'm not a native speaker either, but knowing how to interpret physical laws is crucial in university and much more if one's adventuring in the field of computer science.\n\nEven ignoring Kepler's Third Law, you can reverse engineer the equation using pen and paper and the units of the constant:\n(distance)³ = AU³/day² * (days)²\n(days)² = (distance)³ / (AU³/day²)\ndays = sqrt( (distance)³ / (AU³/day²) )\nT = sqrt(R³ / k)\n\nI think it's an important skill to be able to interpret mathematical laws with pen & paper, especially since Computer Science is full of them!",
