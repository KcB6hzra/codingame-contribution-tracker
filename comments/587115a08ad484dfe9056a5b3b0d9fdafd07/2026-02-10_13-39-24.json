Search can be difficult so I wanted to make a simple as possible BFS puzzle.\n\nIf reviewers feel this is too complicated I would understand.  BFS implementation can be difficult if you lack familiarity with the algorithm.\n\nPlease look over my tests and validations. I know that may be tedious, so if you are not willing, leave the approval for someone else. Additionally, if you think of other corner cases consider contributing them so that I may add the test.\n\nThank you for your interest and feedback.",

I think many participants will have a difficult enough time finding the last index without reconstructing and formatting the shortest path. I included that portion as a comment in my solution.\n\nConsequently, and I agree, a search such as DFS should also solve this challenge.",
