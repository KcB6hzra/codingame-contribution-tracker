    "content": "After receiving two comments on my solution from one year ago about how I wouldn't pass all possible scenarios, I spent some time making changes to my code.\n\nWhile doing that, it became clear to me that the test cases of this puzzle are not very good at all! I have found 4 shortcomings (2 of which Caduchon and suffer3d pointed out already as a comment on my published C++ solution):\n* the direction matters when coming across the same spot as before - see test case 1\n* the starting position doesn't have to be the beginning of a loop (and it might not even be revisited at all) - see test case 2\n* with large n in all test cases, there are always loops - so, there should be a test case with something like n=2 as well (for example, FaizanRizvi’s published C++ solution throws an error for such cases) – see test case 3\n* turning more than once on one spot is possible – see test case 4\n\nTest cases (and validators) like mine below should definitely be added soon so imperfect solutions won't be able to pass any longer.\n\n@BLANC: If you would incorporate these changes it'd be great. If nothing changes in the next days, I'll do it myself. :) If anyone has further thoughts about this or prove my test cases wrong, please say so. Thanks!\n\ntest case 1:\n6 5\n15\n######\n##...#\n#.O#.#\n#....#\n######\nexpected output: 2 3\n\ntest case 2:\n5 5\n13\n#####\n#...#\n#.#.#\n#...#\n#O###\nexpected output: 3 1\n\ntest case 3:\n4 4\n2\n####\n#..#\n#O.#\n####\nexpected output: 2 1\n\ntest case 4:\n5 5\n4\n#####\n#...#\n#.#.#\n#...#\n##O##\nexpected solution: 1 3",

It would help to demonstrate the \"(on same operation)\" thing which I still think is unclear as it is worded now.\n\nLastly, it does not occur in the current test cases but it might be worth consideration and clarification, what if there is an obstacle both in front and right of the robot?",

It would be mean to not include this kind of issue in a visible test case, I think. ;)",
