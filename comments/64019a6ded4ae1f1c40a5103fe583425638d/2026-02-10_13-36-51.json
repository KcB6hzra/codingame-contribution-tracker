I search on Google more efficient solutions but it seems that I already have the most efficient solution in Python.\nI do not approve this contribution because the numbers are too large. Even if you found a solution in Python that work without making an error, I wouldn't agree too because it would be too hard to found and not funny for players.\nI propose to set smaller numbers for the test, because moreover it is not useful to put so big number.\nIf you change that I would be happy to validate your contribution !",
