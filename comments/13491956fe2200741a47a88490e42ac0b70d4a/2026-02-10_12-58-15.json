    "content": "Goal\n* The task is unclear. Please clarify in the statement:\n\n  • What exactly is the role of the key [[K]]?\n  \n  • What should be XOR-ed with what?\n  \n  • Should each ciphertext byte be XOR-ed individually, or is the operation continuous?\n  \n  • How should an ASCII character (the key) be XOR-ed with a hex byte?\n\n* Please format \"K\" as a [[variable]].\n\n* You don't need to describe the input format in this section. \"followed by a space followed by a space separated\" can be simplified to \"and a\".\n\n* Please mention that the ciphertext bytes are provided in lowercase.\n\n* Please specify that the decrypted characters should be concatenated directly, without adding extra spaces between them.\n\nInput\n* Consider splitting the input into two lines, one for [[K]] and one for the hex bytes, for clarity.\n\nConstraints\n* First constraint: Please rewrite it as:\n33 <= ASCII value of [[K]] <= 126\n\n* Second constraint:\n  • The constraints mix representations (decimal vs. hex), which makes them inconsistent. Please specify that 00 and 75 are in hexadecimal.\n\n  • Tests 4/6/7 and Validators 5/6/7 violate this constraint as some bytes exceed 75 in hexadecimal. Please change 75 to 7F.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "Took your advice and made the necessary changes.  Here is what I did.\n\nFormatted K as a variable and mentioned that the bytes are represented as lowercase hex values.\n\nStatement: I added an example of XOR'ing the byte values using the key character.  I also removed the unnecessary explanation of the input.  I mentioned that each byte is individually XORed with the key character.\n\nInput: Changed it from one line to two as per your recommendation.\n\nOuput: Added that the plaintext output should be concatenated with no additional spaces.\n\nConstraints:  Simplified the range of K.  Fixed typo for bytes as the maximum should be 7f and not 75 as seen by an XOR of the letter X and single quote as well as others.  I also added the standard 0x for the byte range values.  \n\nLet me know if I should be more explicit here also would it make more sense to have the K range use the actual characters ! and ~.\n\nFixed tests and validators so that the inputs match the input description of 2 lines.",
