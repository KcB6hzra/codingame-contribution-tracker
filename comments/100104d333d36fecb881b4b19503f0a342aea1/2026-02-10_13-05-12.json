    "content": "This is nice, pretty easy to hack your way to a solution even if you can't remember the formula naturally.\n\nCouple of edits I think would make it more suitable as a Reverse clash:\n1. Put the \"n  ≥ 3\" from the statement (which won't be seen) into the stub generator so that clashers get this information in the clash:\nread N:int\nwrite answer\n\nSTATEMENT\nn  ≥ 3\n\n2. The hardest part about this clash for a lot of coders is going to end up being the formatting rather than the actual coding and pattern-finding. \nIf you have a statement (fastest/shortest modes) then you can just explain the rules (e.g. print with 2 dp, but remove leading zeroes such that 6.00 -> 6.\nBut in Reverse mode you can't explain it so it's a bit hard. Especially since it's not clear from your test cases exactly what the rule is. It could be the example above, or another rule (e.g. print with 2 dp if float, else print as integer). The two examples would differ on how to print \"17.40\" vs \"17.4\", but your solution specifies it would be \"17.40\"... I think it would be kinder to clashers if you just simplify it so that all answers are with 2 decimal places.",

    "content": "I actually solved it assuming it should format \"17.40\" as \"17.4\", so I used sprintf formatting \"%g\" % (\"%.2f\" % answer).\n\nIt didn't matter for any of your tests, but it's good for a Reverse clash to not have any ambiguity in how to solve it, because otherwise you never know if 100% in the tests will translate to 100% on validators.",
