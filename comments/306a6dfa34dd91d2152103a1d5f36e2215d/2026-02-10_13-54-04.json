    "content": "I've made a few sanity (trailing whitespace at the end of validator 3), clarity (I/O format) and esthetic (consistent typography) updates.\n\nI've solved using both memo'd simulation and the proper algorithm, so it's good to go for me, I'm upvoting now and approving as soon as I finish typing this comment.\n(As noted elsewhere, if what you were after was proper algorithm only, the test cases should be made harder)\n\nWhen I was younger and played that, the variant was the \"take-1-to-3 objects\" non-misère one, so I thought my algorithm wouldn't apply there and implemented simulation. Then I discovered how the proper alg was both easier and harder than mine and implemented that too. Thanks for the opportunity to learn something new!\n\n(I've added the heap ordering constraint, as I discovered it was the case in the validators, and it does make memoizing marginally easier, so why not use it.)",

    "content": "with current constraints it is still bruteforce-able. while my attempt with recursion and memoization timed out on the last two testcases, it was doing some pretty suboptimal array operations to get memoization key and to get a copied and modified array to pass to the resursive call. \nmy second approach of filling the array from the low values up instead of recursion was able to fill the full 50x50x50 cases in under half a second. and you don't even have a testcase for 50x50x50 really.\nin other languages, especially ones that can use any structure as key in a map or that have efficient immutable list implementations or are especially good with memoization, etc, even the recursive solution will probably fit within the time limit\n\nif your intent is to have people find the actual strategy a human would use for the game instead of brute-force, you should increase the limits on M substantially.\n\na version with more heaps could also be interesting for those like satine that know the algo for 3 :p",
