    "content": "Nice clash, but the statement is pretty long and confusing so I think a lot of clashers are struggling. I managed to finish it after about 12 minutes in Shortest mode. No other human players got more than 33% though.\n\nThe below part of the statement seems very unnecessary and makes it harder to understand the problem, imo:\n\nWinning Result:\n- A number is drawn within the given fixed range of each cell (except free cell), to determine the winning result.\n- It is drawn in a sequence from left to right, top to bottom.",

It is rather important to know that the listed card and winning numbers are in correspondence, as it could avoid some unnecessarily complex solutions.",

It can be any number as long as its not within the range of 1 to 40. \n\nThe free cell is always won, hence both the \"card\" and \"winning_number\" inputs share the same number, in place of the free cell.",

This is what leads to a correspondence between the card and the winning numbers, which right now is only evident from the test case. Seeing this puzzle with only an understanding of bingo, one might assume that the drawings could be in any order (since bingo game can start with a number in the middle N column, for instance).",
