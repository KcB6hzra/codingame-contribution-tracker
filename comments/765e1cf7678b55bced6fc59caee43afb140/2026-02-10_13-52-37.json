How about something like this?\n\nYour task is to print a grid of width w and height h made out of periods ('.'). Every coordinate on the grid that is inside the rectangle, which has two opposite corners (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), should be a plus sign ('+') instead of a period.\nThe upper-left corner has the coordinate (0, 0).",
