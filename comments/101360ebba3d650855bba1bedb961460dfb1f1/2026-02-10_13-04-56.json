    "content": "Goal\n* It is quite confusing as both the path through walls and the path through doors are described as \"the most optimal path\". Please revise the wording. (My interpretation of the task is to choose the most optimal path, which is either the path through all the walls or the path through all the doors.)\n\n* Suggest to change \"albeit\" to \"either\".\n\n* First paragraph: Suggest to format \"C4\" in <<bold>> instead of as a [[variable]] (twice).\n\n* It is unclear whether a wood door (0 health) still requires a C4 to destroy.\n\nInput\n* As mentioned, please avoid the wording \"the most optimal path\" when describing the possible paths.\n\n* Please add \"<<Line 1>>: An integer\" in front of the first description.\n\n* Please change \"Next [[w]] line(s) will be [[wall]] types,\" to \"<<Next [[w]] lines>>: A string [[wall]] for the type of wall in the path through walls\".\n\n* Please add \"<<Next line>>: An integer\" in front of the third description.\n\n* Please change \"Next [[d]] line(s) will be [[door]] types,\" to \"<<Next [[d]] lines>>: A string [[door]] for the type of door in the path through doors\".\n\n(Also notice that the commas in your original version should be full-stops instead.)\n\nConstraints\n* Please do not format \"> 0\" as a {{constant}} (twice). (You may unformat both characters, or format 0 only.)\n\n* Last constraint: There is an extra \"{{\".\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "Thank you for the suggestions! All were implemented in one form or another.\n\n* changed albeit -> either. Sounds more correct, ty\n\n*Changed C4 to bold instead of variable\n\n*Specified further by adding:\n    -Your only way to damage obstacles is by using <<C4>>.\n    Then, reordering the others so that if you're reading form top-down, it tells you You must remove things, C4 damages things, and the only way to remove things is to damage them no matter the health. Also specified \"(this includes 0 health)\".\n\n*Removed absolutely all mentions of \"optimal path\". Having played the game, the optimal path is important, as there are multiple ways into the center of the base. Having made the clash, I was tunnel visioned into specifying that you are being given the optimal path, and there's no need to \"find\" such a path. However, in hindsight, even mentioning an optimal path to someone just looking at the clash as standalone, adds confusion on top of the two paths that are being given. I really really liked your rephrasing of the Inputs, and think that this helps a lot. Thank you for this.\n\n*I agree with, and really appreciate the next few suggestions for the Input, and all were implemented\n\n*Fixed {{> 0}}!\n\n*Fixed extra \"{{\" \n\nAs always thank you for your input and suggestions :)",
