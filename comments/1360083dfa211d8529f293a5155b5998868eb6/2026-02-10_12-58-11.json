But for now, check to see if CodinGame saved your unpublished edits. If not, you will unfortunately have to make the edits again.\n\nThen, when trying to save the changes, wait for the submit button to become clickable and submit again for the second time. An error should pop up stating that you do not have the most recent version, but after refreshing the page, your edits should show up. This is how I usually make edits to test cases on my clashes/puzzles.\n\nLet me know if that works for you.",
