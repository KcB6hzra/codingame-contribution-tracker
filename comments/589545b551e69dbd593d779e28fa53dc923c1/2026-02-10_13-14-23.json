Seems like it could have been simplified a lot before becoming a clash, but oh well.\n\nThe string manipulation on top of the already challenging problem is like salt in the wound. :P\n\nI was the only one to solve it in my clash, the other 2 human players both got 0% and a bot got 85%.",

    "content": "Cool one, just some minor notes:\n\n- First time I see the expression \"recursive edges\". Did a bit of googling but couldn't find people using it. Otherwise the more standard term is just loop, or self-loop: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(graph_theory)\n- Also maybe non-directional > undirected. Now google says that non-directional is ok, but in my experience only undirected is used.\n- Maybe \"Graph\" without caps to be consistent with the other definitions.\n- You could treat as constants {1, 2} and {2, 1} (-> put in blue)\n- Same for \"ADD\"  & \"DROP\"\n\nThat's all, took me 12 mins, the first 4 being me mistaking simple graph with acyclic and thinking that it made no sense (shame shame shame).\n\nAlso \"A Graph is a data structure...\". That's a programmer brain if I've ever seen one.",

If you don't mind, could you share the solution you came up with? Either on discord (I'm on the cg discord with the same name) or a private forum message, or however else is convenient for you.",
