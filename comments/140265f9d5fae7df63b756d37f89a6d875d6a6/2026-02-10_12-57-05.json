Since this is my first time contributing to the community, I know I still have a lot to learn and it was hard to avoid making some beginner mistakes. Your guidance was incredibly helpful in showing me the right way to do things.\n\nFollowing your advice, I’ve refined the contribution by splitting the input into separate lines, bolding the line numbers with <<Bold>>, and placing each constraint on its own line. I also updated the stub generator with the write answer statement and expanded both the tests and validators to cover the entire alphabet from A to Z. Thank you for helping me grow as a contributor!",

While this isn't ideal, we can leave them unchanged this time since the inputs differ and ensure complete coverage of the alphabet.\n\nThanks.",
