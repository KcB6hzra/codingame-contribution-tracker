    "content": "I agree with you. Maybe instead of the full name  of the bill/coin one could just use its value in the description as well as in the testcases. That would make it less chunky I think.\n\nAs for the actual coding i think a test for no money (so n=0) would make the people that thought of the edge cases profit. \n\nAs well as maybe a test with a fake bill like \"25-dollar-bill\". Even though that would be quite mean, it would provide another edge case. So if OP wants to add it I would suggest making it the last of the tests.",
