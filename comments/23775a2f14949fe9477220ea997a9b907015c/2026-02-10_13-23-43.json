    "content": "Well defined, coded in 1 minute.\nSame as another commenter, we can wait for other comments that might point out some problems, but this is definitely approvable.\n\nAlso, short mode should be pretty interesting:\n - in my code, the input 1 was an exception, handling it could prove interesting in shortest\n - I used two loops with simple increment and conditions, there might be shortcuts to them\n - input and output is very simple, so code size will not depend on language IO method.\n\ngedit tells me my code in shortest is 107 characters long for Python3 code.",

    "content": "Nice! I wrote a list of suggestions/corrections.\n\nGoal:\n* First sentence: \"highly composite numbers\" is one expression, treat it as such. Either put all of it in bold, or don't put any of it in bold. I suggest you bold all of it.\n* First sentence: change \"≤\" to \"smaller than or equal to\".\n* Put the wikipedia link at the bottom, below the note. The note is more important than the link.\n\nInput:\n* The sentence you wrote here is a bit convoluted. You could change it to something simple, like \"An integer N: the upper bound.\", or wait until someone else comes up with a better idea.\n\nOutput:\n* Change \"≤\" to \"smaller than or equal to\".\n\nConstraints:\n* put spaces between the numbers and the smaller-than signs.",

If I don't come back after a few days, please respond to this. I'll see the notification.\nI found one more thing I'd change (didn't see it last time). The A (the positive integer) in the goal section should be formatted as a variable. There are 2 occurences afaik.\nI also tested out the puzzle, and my first solution immediately passed all tests, which means the tests are correct or we both made the same mistakes. I'm hoping for the former :)\n\nI also wonder how short I can make my solution. It would be hard to get this under say 150 characters in shortest mode.",
