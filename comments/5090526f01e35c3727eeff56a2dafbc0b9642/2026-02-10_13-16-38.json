This puzzle, just like several of your other puzzles, is an absolute dream for somebody practicing the basics of Numpy Arrays in Python. For anybody doing Python, I think you are missing out on a tremendous opportunity if you aren't playing around with Numpy on this puzzle. It was super fun to watch 50 test cases / validators get cranked out. I know this is just part of who you are, but we always appreciate your detailed and comprehensive approach to test cases. The write-up is well done and easy to follow. Great job!",

I'm thinking of it as the \"grout\" around the tiles, so I re-worded it as that.\n\nI don't want to use the term \"quadrant\" in the input, because the input is slightly more than exactly 1/4.\n\nI added a test case of ^v (I accidentally left those out of my program that I used to create all the test cases.... amazing that you caught that !!!)\n\n\"Sometimes\" is correct.  For example, you don't always flip a \"M\" to an \"W\" -- you only flip those when flipping down, not when flipping sideways.  So that is why I'm saying sometimes.\n\nYou said:\n* Is it correct to state that in the input:\n   • () {} [] <> /\\ never appear as the last character in each line, and\n   • ^v AV wm WM un /\\ never appear in the last line?\n...Yes, that is correct\n\n(I will check all the input for extra spaces)\n\nIf you don't mind, please review again and let me know.",
