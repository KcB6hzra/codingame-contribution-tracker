    "content": "Thank you for your feedback! I believe I have made most of the suggested edits, although I have some follow-up questions on the test cases.\n\nTests/Validators 1 & 2 both test probabilities without overlap (there aren't two possible sets you could form with the same card). Therefore, the same n will necessarily result in the same probability.\n\nI have changed test 2 to have n = 6 instead of 5, but I am unsure about test/validator 1. I feel like even though it isn't an edge case, it makes sense to include the minimum n as both a test and validator. However, this does mean they will have the same answer regardless of what the two cards are. So I'm not sure what is best here.\n\nAlso, there is always at least one card which completes the set as long as you have n <= 2, so the expected output cannot be 0, although I could change the constraints if you think that would make more sense.",

I appreciate your quick reply and edits.\n\nI understand your point about the probability never being 0 in the current setup, and that makes perfect sense; no need to change the constraints and force an impossible case there.\n\nRegarding the tests and validators: if you feel that n = 5 is an important edge case worth keeping, please do restore the original validator. In that case, though, please add additional pairs of cases so that we end up with fewer validators expecting the same output as their corresponding tests. At the moment, 3 out of 6 share the same output, so reducing that to less than half would be better.\n\nThanks again.",
