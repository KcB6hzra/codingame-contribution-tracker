    "content": "I think it is far more easy to get than some other reverse exercises out there... I gave 7 examples.\n\nFrom the 6th example you can deduce that the result is close to M*P/2 (4950 vs 4901), or even either (M-1)*P/2 or M*(P-1)/2 (both 4900 vs 4901).\nThen where do the 1 come from, as you have N that is 2 ? why not dividing it by 2 as is the multiplication above ?\nFrom test 3 you see you cannot run M-1, so in the multiplication it must be P-1.\nTest 3 tells you also to return the floor value (5/2 ➡ 2)\nAnd then... it works for anything except 2nd test. Some special case if n = 0, the result must be 0.\nDone.\n\nMaybe adding a test for P big and N and M below 10 could help people see better the contribution of P?",

    "content": "It is easy to justify what steps could have been taken in hindsight, but I really don't think it is intuitive to come across those specific steps without more hints. \n\nAdditionally, the stub says \"number of pluggable computers\", meaning that when the clash is loaded, print(\"number of pluggable computers\") will be in the default code, which adds confusion for reverse mode. Also keep in mind that the test case names don't appear in reverse mode (they are just \"Test 1\", \"Test 2\", etc).\n\nIf you want to make a reverse clash in this same vein, I think you should create a new contribution dedicated to reverse mode and get other's opinions on it as a reverse clash.",
