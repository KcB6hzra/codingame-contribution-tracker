    "content": "The idea is fine, but there are some big things you need to change.\n\n* Can't be binary output. I recommend changing the puzzle from just \"who wins?\" to also include \"how much hp does the winner have left?\"\n\n* The statement is too long for CoC. At first glance, it seems that a good deal of it is redundant with the Input section, so you can trim down the statement down somewhat - try to get to around 1/2 of its current length.\n\n* Thematically, it makes no sense for the battle to continue while one side is dead, so it makes it hard to understand this edge case. You can either remove such cases or change the Log to reflect \"planned actions\" instead of \"past actions.\"\n\n* Constraints should have lower and upper bounds specified.",
