The shift and rotate operations are a bit excessive, I totaly agree with you is a bit too much for nothing :D ).\n\nI took your advice and fixed the flaws you highlighted:\n- I reduced the number of operations to only four (keeping the most error-prone ones).\n- I reordered the test cases so that the four operations are the first ones displayed in reverse (two operations with output 'false' and two with 'true').\n- I renamed the shift operations to 'L' and 'R' as you suggested.",
