It's hard to debug problems like this, so when you have an error in your logic it can be hard to figure out the issue.\n\nIn the end, my main problem was that I was thinking of the maximum profit as being defined by the unit profit, but really it needs to be defined by the actual profit you can make from it based on how many units you can actually afford to buy that day! It's a nice touch, but can make it tricky.",

I have inserted a new test case ahead of all the rest, showing as the example, where there are other items that have greater unit profit, profit ratio, or total sales amount than the best choice, which by definition has the greatest total profit and so results in the highest balance, over just one day. I can't promise that it will be under 5 minutes with such an error, but hopefully at least this could make debugging a lot easier, being ironed out much sooner and not in the thicket of later test cases.",

    "content": "I think that's a good idea, but if I were you I'd make that test case even clearer with perhaps just 2 different commodity options to choose from. Currently it's perhaps still not so obvious where the final profit of 55 from one day has come from. With only 2 options, it can be a lot easier to see which one was chosen and backtrack the solution logic.",

    "content": "Sure, I'll cut it down to 3 options. Unfortunately there isn't a way to get everything down to one alternative option for all the erroneous measures that someone might apply. In particular, a player might suspect that the total sales for the day would correspond with the highest final balance, but this is not true if the costs are relatively lower for a smaller sales amount. I know that's not the problem you ran into, but it's conceivably an easy mistake to make.",
