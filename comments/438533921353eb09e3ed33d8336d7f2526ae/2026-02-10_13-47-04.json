    "content": "Niako already detected/answered your point 2. (thanks!)\n\nAbout point 1, I'll update the C/D/E/F parameters that were indeed ambiguous. Thanks!\nThe other occurrences of \"size\" are in the clash qualification definitions, they're before \"diameter\" is even mentioned (one of them is actually explicitly a surface), and they don't introduce any ambiguity since whichever size-like measure of a sphere you use, it preserves both ordering and distinctness.\n\nPS: I'll leave it as \"increasing\" instead of the more expected \"non-decreasing\" because a) it's real ugly b) the case where it changes something to the output won't happen",
