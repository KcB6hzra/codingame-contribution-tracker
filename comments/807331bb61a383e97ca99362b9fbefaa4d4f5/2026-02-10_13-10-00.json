Also typo therefore is missing an \"e\".\nI didn't modify it because I'm not sure if the entire second paragraph should be modified.\nhere is what I think should be written:\n\n\nDNFs are always considered worse than any actual time. So if there is only one DNF in a set of 5 solves, both that solve and the lowest/best time result are removed. Therefore the highest/worst time is actually part of the final 3 times.\nBut if there are 2 or more DNFs, the entire average is considered a DNF.",

    "content": "Yeah I did initially think that it would be simpler to just consider a DNF the worst time period. But A) the way the problem is written now is actually how they calculate the average in competitions, and I want to stay loyal to that, and B) it adds a little extra challenge that requires some extra thinking, which just makes it better. \nYes, I know I probably didn't do the best job explaining the requirements in the problem, I'll see if I can change the wording a bit to make it easier to understand.\nThanks for your feedback! Much appreciated",
