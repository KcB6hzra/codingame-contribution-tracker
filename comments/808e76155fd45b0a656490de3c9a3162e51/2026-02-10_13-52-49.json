    "content": "Nice challenge, but could use at least one more test/validator pair.\n\nI just got this in a clash and misread the puzzle as \"replace the LAST word starting with c with covfefe\", and I got 100% on the test cases, so I submitted. Ended up with 75% on validators.\n\nIt would be good to add a test case where the longest c word isn't also the last one, so that others can't make such a mistake. :)",

    "content": "Hey,\n\nI had an idea for a testcase while solving this: you could have two c-words with same length, with one of them also having a coma or something at the end to make it seem longer if the string split is done without caution. For example:\n\n[...] commonly, [...] clearest [...]\n\nHere \"commonly,\" might seem one character longer than \"clearest\" because of the coma, but they actually have the same length and it is then the later word that should be replaced.\n\n\nFunny challenge that you’ve come up with there! ;)",
