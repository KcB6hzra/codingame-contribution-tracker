    "content": "Hi, \nI'm on a big deal to know the current acceleration of my missiles when they have been just fired. We have to know acceleration because when a missile is given the WAIT command, its last acceleration is preserved.\nSo, to guess the acceleration on new missiles, I have to memorize the acceleration given by my ship command \" | M ax ay\", and next turn I have to detect in the input data which unit corresponds to the new missile. And there, there is a little problem : \nI cannot compare the idents because I don't know how many new units will appear from the opponent\nI could compare coordinates but to do so, I have to simulate the missile move on the five ticks\nI could find which missile from new input was not present in the last input, and it is probably the simplest method.\nAnother solution would be to get this information in the input... \nDue to the data conservation from a round to another, coding the simulator is a bit tricky.\nI could consider too that guessing all that is a part of the challenge :D",

Then the line for your ship should be\n1 | A 3 2 | F -4 7\n\nIf you want your ship to just wait in this turn, you print\n1 | W\n\nThe same goes for any of your missiles. So say you own a ship (id 23) and two missiles (ids 9 and 11). You want the ship to wait and both missiles to detonate. Then you print 3 lines:\n23 | W\n9 | D\n11 | D\n\nDoes it answer your question?",

We added the information about the origin of the map to the description.\n\n> you have to fire relative to your ship instead of at a given point - not so easy for beginners. So maybe make the game easier in the beginner leagues.\n\nThe premise of the game was to remain fairly physically accurate, and as such bullets inherit the velocity of the ship when fired. \n\nThat means firing at a given position (that is, firing in such a way that hitting the given point is guaranteed) would require taking the ship's velocity into account. This would make it somewhat annoying to use for someone who wants to do the targeting manually (which I think is required at any non-trivial level), as they would effectively need to reverse the computation to fire in the direction they want. In that situation I feel like firing in a selected direction is more natural.\n\nDo you have an idea how the beginner leagues could be simplified? The guidelines suggest interface should not change between leagues, and I also wouldn't want to change existing game mechanics between leagues - I recall I was quite annoyed in other games when it turned out what I wrote to leave lower leagues made little sense in the full game.\n\n>  the image (2 horses on a hill) doesn't seem to have any connection to the game.\n\nYes, for some reason contributions are shown with the author's profile picture, and we don't know if it is possible to change it (looking at the list of contributions no one else was able to do that).",

And as I understood \"rounds\" are the same as \"turns\", then only one word should be used for it, for better clarity, given that we also got \"ticks\".\n\nAbout the inertia on the bullets (adding velocity from the ship), it takes just a subtraction to correct it, which I think is kinda simple compared to estimating where a moving enemy ship might be in X turns.\n\nAs a suggestion for simplifying the beginner's league, I think the ships might start just a little closer together so that one can get started just by firing at the other's direction with max bullet speed, without the need to move and still dealing some (not full) damage. So, with simpler commands and math, one still gets some results.",
