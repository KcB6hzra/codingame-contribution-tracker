    "content": "Amazing graphics and a nice idea for a game!! I haven't tried it yet but I will when I get the time.\n\n1 question - ¿Do the dice have standard configuration (7 adding the two opposite faces) or random? ¿Is this for a game-rules reason?\n1 idea - You are worried about the strategy of all sixes. Would it be possible to add a restriction? for instance a numerical one: max num of overall dice points (e.g. 6 for the first one + 3,5 * number of additional dice - rounded), or a logical one: a dice cannot roll into the same face.\n\nCongratulations!",

So the player had to make move to be consistent with this objective.\nThe winner is the one having taken the more dices.\nTo avoid draw @ 200 turns, the winner is the one having the better sum of all the remaining dices if the two players have taken the same among of dice.\nThe 3-D animation is amazing !\nThanks for this proposal.",
