The straightforward rules for input and output, along with reasonable constraints, make it approachable. The mix of test cases featuring different actors and scenarios adds a nice variety to test basic problem-solving skills.",

If someone jumps straight to clash of code with little to no knowledge of such practice and elementary algorithms, then those person expose themselves to have a rough time. To be honest, i'm pretty sick of 20-seconds clashs consisting in printing A*B or similar problems. This one feels just fine to me, perfect balance between difficulty and time required to code.",
