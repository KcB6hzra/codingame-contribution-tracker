Despite this, I found that this puzzle was far easier to debug and understand than my previous When Pigs Fly puzzle, so therefore I classify this puzzle as Hard.\n\nDo you think I should provide a link to the equation for projectile motion within the statement?

There can be no advantage to wait before taking the buff, so only at most 3 options : stay in A, move to B, or move to B and buff. The situation with or without buff is therefore the same, just with different constants. If you move, you'll need to shoot all reachable only from A, plus whatever more you want, all at cost 3\" (since max fly time is less than the zip time). Then what remains from B (including those only reachable from there), starting with the longest fly time (from B ). So I think you can be sure that it can never be good to shoot from B any ufo that can be reached from both A and B while not also shooting all the ones that have a shortest fly time (from B ). So I sort ufos that can be shot from both towers by fly time from B, and test all splits, so in the end a complexity of O(#ufos) (with an additional log because of sorting).",
