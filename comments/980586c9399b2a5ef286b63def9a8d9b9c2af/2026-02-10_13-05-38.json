You may format it in <<bold>> or leave it unformatted.\n\n* Please change \"invoice's\" to \"invoice\".\n\n* Please change \"statement's\" to \"statement\".\n\nInput\n* Please change \"Integer\" to \"An integer\" (twice) for consistency.\n\nOutput\n* Please delete \"Next\".\n\n* Please add \"One match \"\n\n* Please format \"-\" as a {{constant}} and remove the quotation marks.\n\n* Please add \"Invoice amounts are separated by a space.\"\n\nConstraints\n* Please add \"There are no cases where a match can only be made between multiple bank statements with one or multiple invoices, e.g. 2 4 - 6 or 2 4 - 1 5.\"\n\n* Please add \"1 ≤ [[K]] ≤ 26\" (so we don't have to worry what letter to use if K is greater than 26).\n\nCases\n* Please make Validator 4 a bit more different from Test 4, by changing all statement and invoice amounts to be different between the two cases.\n\nThanks.",

Please change \"In case there are multiple ways to match a payment entry, invoice amounts are displayed in the given order.\" to:\n\nIn case a payment entry is matched to multiple invoices, the invoices are output in the given order. In case there are multiple ways to match a payment entry, [insert your instruction here].\n\n* In the above point, the instruction here refers to the original case pointed out by @cedricdd: Should I allocate 7 3 to A or B? Should I allocate 10 to A or B? You have to explain the basis.\n\nCases\n* As there are no cases where multiple ways of allocation are possible (see the point above), do you intend to add a few more pairs of such cases?\n\n* (Optional) You may add cases where an invoice amount is negative (i.e. the invoice is actually a credit note, which gives a discount or a refund).\n\n* Do you plan to increase the number of cases? I would think it is a good idea. You can include more complex cases where [[N]] and [[M]] are larger and at the same time more combinations / trials and errors are necessary before finding the final answer.\n\nThanks.",

You'd need an additional test(+validator) to break this logic. You'll also need an additional test(+validator) where no account is correct in first try. Be sure to also explain all special cases so that there's only one possible solution.\n\nexample :\n7\n3\n10\n12\n4\n2\n3                  => A 9 - 4 3 2                A 9 - 4 3 2\n2                  => B 24 - 14 10    Or    B 24 - 12 10 2 \n1                  => C 15 - 12 2 1            C 15 - 14 1\n14\n9\n24\n15\n\nYou need to set standards, such as sorting invoices from smallest to largest. Then how are the invoices distributed? Do we always try to allocate the largest invoices to the first payment entries, if not, how is this done?\n\nIn itself, the addition of the tests I've mentioned isn't all that compulsory for an easy puzzle. However, if you wanted to make an episode 2 of this puzzle with a little more complexity, I think it could be a good line of thought.",
