I would like it even better with bounds requiring O(n log n) and large weights (1e9 or 1e18), as it has a nice solution (my solution was 31 lines of C++) based on combining two applications of the classic Longest Increasing Subsequence problem. You're welcome to make a sequel with larger constraints.",

Could even have multiple switches to control! Could even become a java game with the SDK.",
