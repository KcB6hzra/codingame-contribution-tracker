You only test letters with index > 4 in validators.\n- Some test and validators are the same, please change them. \n\nI know I am being a little harsh by rejecting this but it's for improving clash quality.",

    "content": "Well, the question above was specifically how to balance the puzzle between the different languages and I was answering the question.\n\nAs for if it is a good idea, it is better if contribution is balanced between languages. Winning or losing the CoC should not be too much dependent on the language that player chooses from the 25+ languages supported in the CoC to solve any puzzle – especially in Fastest or Reverse modes.\n\nBut if mode is Shortest, then some languages may always have advantage depending on a particular puzzle and it could be hard to balance in Shortest mode.\n\nSo, I conclude that more balanced a puzzle is the more desirable it is in general, especially for Fastest and Reverse modes. But for the Shortest mode there can be an exception though.",
