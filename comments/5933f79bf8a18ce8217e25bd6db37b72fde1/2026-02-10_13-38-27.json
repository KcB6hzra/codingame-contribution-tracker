    "content": "(One of my first comments so could be missing the point.)\n\nI think you are assuming that pizzas can only be placed in horizontal and vertical grid. For example, you say that \"If John needs to carry 2 pizzas of the same size [radius 8], he would need a 32x32 tray.\" However, the pizzas fit on an approximately 27.3 x 27.3 tray if placed diagonally from one another. (You can calculate this exactly with Pythagoras' theorem or just try drawing the diagram and measuring it.)\n\nYou could fix this by changing the pizzas to be square (such as changing the story to be about boxes or just saying that the pizzas have to be arranged in a grid for some reason).\n\n(If you stick to the question as-is, allowing non-grid placements, the calculations get way more complex for the bigger numbers of pizzas so it would seem better as a hard classic puzzle or something.)",
