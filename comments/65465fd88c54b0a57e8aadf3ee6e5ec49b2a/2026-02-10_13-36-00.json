    "content": "The statement is confusing. I think it would be best to not give an example where \"8 is the biggest value in the list\", because it makes it seem like the problem is about 8 being the size of a byte and some coders will assume 8 for all test cases and end up very confused how to deal with numbers greater than 8 later on.\n\nI just got this as a clash and didn't understand it until I came here afterwards.",
