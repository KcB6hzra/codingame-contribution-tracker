Line 1- An integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4), the number of actions to perform.) to the constraints section, so it would turn into <<Line 1>>: An integer [[N]] for the number of actions to preform, and the constraints section would be 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4? That would make it easier to read, but I didn't see 5DN1L mention that.\n\n   - can you make Line 2 to => <<Next [[N]] lines>>: the action to preform, and then move the explaining for [[A]] to the goal section?\n\n\n*Constraints section:\n\n   - Can you move your current constraints section to the goal section as it is not really an constraint?\n\n*Test case section:\n   - I think you should add some test cases where the energy left is an positive number, and one for when the energy left is 0\n\n\n\n- Please also to remember use the [[variable fortmat]] if you are using an variable(such as mentioning [[A]] in your goal section, ect)\n- Also read and change the suggestions 5DN1L makes!\n\n\nOverall, I think this would be a really cool puzzle to do! Once you fix these and the things pointed out by 5DN1L, it should be ready! I am looking forward to seeing it in action!\n\nP.S. someone tell codinGame to support tab in comments 💀",

You may refer to the explanation here:\nhttps://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/test-cases#guidelines\n\nBasically you would want each pair to test similar situations.\n\nActually, I don't understand why going into negative energy is allowed. If you disallow that, then it's easier to define different pairs, e.g. pair 1 is about having sufficient energy without ever going into negative, pair 2 is about having just enough energy, pair 3 is about not having enough energy midway, and so on.\n\nIf you still need to understand more about tests and validators, please let me know.",
