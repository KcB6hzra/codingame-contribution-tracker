    "content": "This is a fun little thing. I think I've found one of the shortest solutions in python (39 characters), and it's a shame it just uses builtins.\n\nGoal section:\n* Maybe it's better if you only use the first and last sentences in the goal section. With how short this text is, it's unnecessary and a bit confusing if you add big warning signs saying this one sentence may not be useful to read. Why don't you let people figure that out for themselves? It's only one sentence. People can already figure out halfway through the sentence that \"ah, this is about the definition of a hexadecimal number, I can skip this\" and go look at the following text or start programming.\n\nTests:\n* The 4th validator has only zeroes. I'd consider this a special case, so I'd like to see it as a test case instead of a validator. For the validator of that test case, you can then put a string of zeroes of a different length. As a separate test and validator pair, you can then have the test case with lots of (but not all) zeroes.",

I have the same name there)\nThat being said, I rewrote my solution, and now it's apparently 37 characters? No idea why it jumped to 39 characters when I last did it. Maybe I'm going blind. I'm using the sum builtin with a generator expression and `int(i,16)` to convert one hex character to an int. Remove unnecessary spaces, and voila. :) Maybe I should add that you don't need spaces between brackets and keywords/variables.",
