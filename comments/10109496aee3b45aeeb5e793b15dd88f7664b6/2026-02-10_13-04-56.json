    "content": "Goal\n* 3rd bullet point: The last part (\"until a minimum of 1\") is a bit unclear. Do you mean \"until the climber's score for that problem reaches 1 point\"? Or \"until the climber's total score reaches 1 point\"? Please rewrite for clarity.\n\n* 4th bullet point: The first part (\"A climber will receive 0\") sounds odd. Actually it is the clash player who will receive 0 as the input. Also, the tense of the verb is inconsistent with the other points. Suggest to rewrite as follows:\n\n- A climber who does not reach the top at all will receive 0 points. In this case, the number of attempts will be recorded as 0.\n\n* 5th bullet point: I don't understand this point. Do you mean \"is/are ranked\" instead of \"start/starts\"? Is it special terminology used in bouldering competitions? Or can we just simply mention that the climbers are ranked based on their scores (the higher the better)?\n\n* Can \"last\" be replaced by \"best\"?\n\n* I also don't understand how tie-breaking works: first we sort by qualification scores, then we sort by qualification scores (again) in a tie?\n\nInput\n* Please add \"[[B]] integers for\" before \"the number of attempts\".\n\nOutput\n* Please change \"climbers\" to \"climber\".\n\n* Can \"last\" be replaced by \"best\"? Can \"with the highest score\" be deleted?\n\nGame modes\n* It's almost impossible to guess the requirement in Reverse mode. Suggest to disable that mode.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "Thanks for the review. I think I integrated most of your comments. \n\nThe only open point is the the tiebreaking mechanism: The input is sorted by their qualification results (so the for test 1 Charlie won the qualification and therefore starts last). This is what I want to clarify in the 5th bullet point, but apparently it still needs some rework.\nI replaced score by result and also added even more content.\n\nClimbers start in reverse order of their qualification scores (best climber of the qualification starts last which means he is at the bottom of the input list). If they are tied in the final, the climber with the better qualification score wins.\n-->\nClimbers start in the reverse order of their qualification results, with the best climber of the qualification starting last, i.e. at the bottom of the input list. If they are tied in the final, the climber with the better qualification result wins.\n\nI believe reversing is possible but agree that it's quite difficult in 15 minutes to handle all the edge cases presented in the test cases and therefore removed the reverse mode.",
