I think it is not too easy or too hard, it can be solved relatively fast in fastest and reverse, in my opinion it is good for shortest, because there are many different ways to solve this puzzle and it is not clear what is shortest way. Thing I think you should improve is test cases for \"diagonal\", I think points are always sorted and with same difference between two consecutive points, correct me if I am wrong. Considering everything I think this puzzle should be added to clash of code.",

Maybe I would remove the test with two \"0 0\" points because it's not very clear what should be the output in this case. Also did you make the points equal distance on purpose? How about adding tests like:\n0 0\n6 2\n21 7\n9 3",
