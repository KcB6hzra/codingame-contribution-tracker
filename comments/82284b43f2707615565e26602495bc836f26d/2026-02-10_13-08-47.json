I am a bit at a loss on what to look for; do you happen to know anything that would be special about validator 5 versus all other cases?\n\nEDIT: I found it - at validator 5 there is a comma at the end of your first movie listing (Aishi Roy,). Therefore my python .split turned that name into 'Aishi Roy,'. I think it is not something you meant to put in (I get the impression you meant to make the listing consistent and easy for parsing, with the ':' between title and cast and ',' supposed to separate actors, and no colons or commas in names to mess with the player).",
