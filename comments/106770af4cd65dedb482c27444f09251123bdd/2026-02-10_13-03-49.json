    "content": "This is a nice clash! I did however need to make some assumptions that are not explicitly stated. The situation assumes that you are fully and directly behind the other car, and on separate lanes (so that the distance you have to overtake is l1 + l2).  There are other situations possible, that are not excluded by your statement currently: you are driving behind the other car (and have to move around him); you are driving level with the other car (and hence only need l2).\n\nAlso, the phrasing 's m straight sections' gave me the impression that it was a road that has a couple of sections with overtake possibility, and that you somehow had to find out at which section you could take your chance. But, instead, it is a single section of s meter that you are currently on.\n\nSuggestion to rephrase to something like:\n\"You are driving on the left lane of a two-lane road, your front bumper level with the backside bumper of another car on the right lane. There is s meter (m) left for overtaking. Both vehicles ...\"",
