However, since the maximum value of N, the output is 120, it could be in the constraints that it is smaller or equal than 120.\nAlso I don't know what others think about this, but personally I find it easier to work with a while loop (in Java) \n\"while (Scanner.hasNextInt)\n{\nint number = in.nextInt();\n}\"\nthan with a String\n\"String numbers = in.nextLine();\"\nalso I don't know if it is possible to change this, it would be nice for java.\nI amde a couple mistakes, maybe I learned something and improved and I had some fun with this.\nAlso quite interesting for fastest, shortest personally I don't enjoy, if you don't use Python 3 or Ruby basically you have 0 chances of winning. But you could say that it is rather a problem of the game mode.\nbasically 5 stars in my opinion.",
