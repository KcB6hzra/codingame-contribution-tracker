This is a classical task.\nWhy not REVERSE and FASTEST? \n\nI would add a test case with very short words which makes it perfectly clear that if the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right. IMHO this point is a bit difficult to recognise from your test cases.\n\n17\nabc def ghi jkl mno p q r stuv wxy z\n\nabc  def  ghi jkl\nmno  p  q  r stuv\nwxy z",
