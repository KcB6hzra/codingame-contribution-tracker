I did it in reverse mode and it is simple and fast to solve.\nFor now I would approve it for reverse mode.\nHowever for shortest mode, you should make your statement clearer because this can be solved in a very short time (less than 1min for good players in fastest) and statement has to be very clear and concise.\nExample:\nYou must decode a [[message]] using a [[key]] composed of digits.\nFor each digit <<d>> in [[key]] with <<i>> the index of <<d>>: if <<d>> is strictly greater than zero, print  the <<dth>> character of <<ith>> word of [[message]].\n\nIt is important for your players to have several ways to solve this problem. The reverse mode is very cool and the fastest and shortest modes only need a clearer statement. :)",
