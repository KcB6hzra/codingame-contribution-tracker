    "content": "This is easy enough to solve as a chess player, but I'm not sure if this would be solvable for someone who has never played Chess and doesn't understand that pawns are weakest and Queens are strongest. It might be too hard to reverse engineer without the prior knowledge of chess.\n\nI feel like I can't give an unbiased opinion on whether this clash is appropriate for Reverse as a chess player, but hopefully some non-players give this a go and can see if it is solvable for them. The test case names make it clear it is chess, so I guess worst case scenario they could Google \"queen chess value\" and start to confirm their hunch..",
