I know this topic is subjective but the majority of medium puzzles are a lot easier than this.\n - I'm using probabilities to make educated guesses when there are no deterministic choices but I don't think I can reach a 50% winrate even with that. It's the nature of the game but somehow this doesn't feel right on CG. On the other hand it also means you could make a super basic algorithm and submit until it works.",

    "content": "It's hard to set the difficulty IMO, not even the official CG puzzles are consistent. Both \"there is no spoon\" (just listing the neighbors or a cell) and \"dwarths standing on the shoulders of giants\" (graph theory) are medium.\n\nIt also depends on the way you solve the puzzle. I ran just my program 10 times, 6 were successful (admittedly a small sample size) and there are a few things that I could tweak. If you accept a lower success rate (as you only have to pass once), it gets easier to code.\n\nSo, what do you see as the alternative? Tell the user where to start (or do the first click in the referee already) and design the testcases to be solvable from there? I guess that would work. But then it doesn't feel like good old minesweeper anymore.\nAnd we already have that deterministic version: https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/minesweeper",

    "content": "If I clean up my code I'll end up with something around 150 lines, I don't expect to have that much for a medium puzzle. I'm fine if you leave it as is though, I just think it's more appropriate as hard.\n\nFor the randomness I mostly don't like the 50/50 situations. In a playable version I would probably offer the player a hint in this case, to avoid ending their whole game on a coin toss. For this puzzle I don't really have a solution. Making grids without those situations would probably require generating them over and over until your solver doesn't find any 50/50 chance. But the generation could end up taking a long time.",
