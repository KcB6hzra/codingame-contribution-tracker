L'algorithme est simple, mais la terminologie pourrait rebuter les non-initiés. Une contextualisation enfantine du principe d'Aufbau rendrait l'exercice plus engageant tout en conservant sa valeur pédagogique : des boîtes ou des tiroirs d'une commode portant des noms (1s, 2s, etc..) serait peut-être plus appréciable.\nMais sinon, je trouve que ce sujet correspond totalement à un CoC, bien qu'il puisse sembler un peu difficile à aborder. Il se résout ensuite assez facilement en utilisant les collections semblables aux dictionnaires !",

    "content": "Cool idea for a puzzle. I appreciate that you indicated the atomic numbers where the special rule applies.\n\nAlthough this problem is doable, the fact that your solution is 20+ lines of code seems indicative that this problem is too difficult for the fastest game mode, let alone the shortest game mode. I do have some prior chemistry knowledge which makes it easier for me but way harder for those who have to spend a minute or two just reading the problem statement.\n\nI would encourage you to instead consider the reverse puzzle, where your input provides the electron configuration and you require the total number of electrons as output instead. This way, the player need not know about all the different conventions and special rules and can instead focus on the suffix of each orbital configuration.\n\nIf you want to make it harder, you can consider providing the condensed electron configuration instead.",

    "content": "Honestly, this would be a cool puzzle, but it's way too hard for clash of code.\nI spent 15 minutes on it and could only JUST solve up to \"Exceptions\" in that time. I gave up on the exceptions.\nThere's no way anyone is solving this in 5 minutes... reading all of the statement alone takes 5 minutes.\n\nThis is coming from someone with a degree in quantum science, lol. I think you should maybe submit this as a puzzle instead. If you also want to have a clash version then it needs to be way simpler:\n1. Get rid of the string formatting \"H = ....\", just allow the answer to be the electron configuration and the input to be the atomic number (no symbols). e.g. 1 -> \"1s1\", 4 -> \"1s2 2s2\". It might even be better to not have \"n\" elements per test and just have one element per test.\n\n2. Get rid of the exceptions, it's way beyond the level of a clash to learn about how transition metals behave... I would just put a note saying that the atomic number will never be 24, 29, 42 or 47.\n\n3. Get rid of the long examples or at least the 2nd one. Having a really long statement scares clashers off and they usually end up just submitting nothing for 0%, assuming that the clash is too hard for them.\n\nI think with those changes, it would be a fun clash. Still very hard to solve in 5 minutes, but possibly doable.\n\nOtherwise, this is a great 'easy' puzzle, imo. I suggest you submit this version as a puzzle and then if you feel up for it, edit this to a simpler version for a clash.",
