    "content": "Should clarify that lengthMin and lengthMax won't appear multiple times in the conditions.\n\nThis is a really hard clash, especially for Shortest mode, where a lot of things aren't clear, so you can't tell if it's ok to take shortcuts.\n\nIn my clash just now, no one could solve it. I won with 80% and spent the full 15 minutes attempting to solve it.\nhttps://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/41346227f6a71293457a76615106845ce85af16\n\nIn the end, I was stumped because I'd mistakenly assumed that if a character appears in both \"Include\" and \"Exclude\" then there's an \"ERROR\", but as long as ALL the Include characters aren't in Exclude, then it's still possible to make a valid password.\n\nI think this clash is unnecessarily complicated and difficult. It would be better if you kept it simple in my opinion, as right now it's almost impossible to understand and solve in 15 minutes - let alone the 5 minutes a clash is meant to be solvable within...",
