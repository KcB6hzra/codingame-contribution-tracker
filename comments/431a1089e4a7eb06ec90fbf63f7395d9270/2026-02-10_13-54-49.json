I would suggest to make it clearer.\n\n- To make it completly clear, I would add an example of the square representation of the message (by instance, with CodinGame:\n\nCia\nonm\ndGe",

    "content": "Well, this time it is really more clear but I would say... a little bit too much :-)\n\nFor a clash of code format, you want to quickly read the statement and start as fast as possible.\n\nIt's why, one sentence for the context/the little joke might be enough. Then your example is good but should be more concise. \nIn my opinion the example part should be reduced like this\n\n---\n\nGiven a string , \"CiaonmdGe\" (9 characters), divide it in equals rows and columns (here 3 rows, 3 columns):\nCia\nonm\ndGe\n\nAnd print the concatenation of all the columns, top  to down, left to right, in one line of text: \"CodinGame\"\n\n----\n\nAnd no more.",
