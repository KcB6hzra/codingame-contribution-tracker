    "content": "The indexing of your problem is extremely misleading and  confusing.\n\nYou provide the mountains in a list that is unsorted, then ask for the player to give the indices of the mountains that they can see. But instead of indexing based on your list, you actually ask them to index based on the sorted list.\nYou should just give the mountains as a sorted list so there is no confusion about the indices, or not ask for mountain indices at all and just ask for the mountain distances as a response. To use indices that aren't related to the original list is very confusing.\n\nWhat's worse is that none of the test cases will actually help a clasher notice this issue if they are giving the indices based on the first list. They will get 100% and only fail on 1 validator \"5 other mountains, 3 hidden \".\nIt's very annoying to get 100% on test cases and then 80% on the actual submission because of hidden  edge cases in validators and misleading statements..",
