However, one aspect that may be seen as less appealing is that when all words from the list have been chosen, the player who is forced to make the last move may end up losing the game, even if their move was optimal. This situation occurs because the game ends as soon as a player cannot make a valid move, potentially penalizing them for the turn order rather than their strategy or skill.",
