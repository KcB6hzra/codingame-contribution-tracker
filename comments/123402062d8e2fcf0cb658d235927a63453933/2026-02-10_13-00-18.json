    "content": "This is a decent clash, but way too hard to be in Reverse.\n\nIt would be hard enough to just figure out that you need to separate it into bytes and sum them, but then the rules about non-overlapping segments and 'not starting with 0 (except for 0)' are just way too much to expect from Reverse clashers.\n\nI just got this in Reverse and no-one solved it. The highest score was 66%, then 4 people got 55% and the rest got 0%. Please disable Reverse mode.",

    "content": "I took time to understand it correctly trying to read from right to left and vice versa. At the end re-re-reading the explaination I understood it's a matter of finding 8 bits string not starting with a 0 meaning we need to remove this caracter until we found a 1 or end of th string... Then comes optimisation loops but as I took 20 min not sure I would have even succeed on time.",

    "content": "nice puzzle... but first i think you must explain better how to construct each sub segment,  example in the Goal section might be great.. i don't know if i understand it well but i think this example explain what you want  to do in the puzzle:\n\nexample length 13:\n0001010101111\nthe first segment is: 10101011 (we does not count left zeroes)\nthe second segment is: 11\nthe sum decimal of the binaries is: 171 + 3 = 174\n\nsecond, it is not clear that the segments must be extract from left to right of the string...  in the example i started from left to right but from right to left the segments might looks like 10101111 and 10 witch sum is 177.... it must be clear in the Goal section what direction is to get the segments\n\nthird.... the Constraints n is between 1 and 100, then more cases to cover uniformly that range might be good.\n\nand lastly, i think game mode reverse  is not good this puzzle",

    "content": "This comment identifies a test case (or several) that is definitely missing.\n\nHowever, I don't see the value in the criteria \"not starting with 0 (except for 0)\". I think that criteria should be removed, and the test case above should be treated as \"00010101 01111\". It does not make sense to me that ANY early number in a multi-part input must start with a 1. What about the input \"000100010000010001000\"? According to your current rules, it seems like the appropriate split into 8-bit integers is \"10001000 10001000\", ignoring the 0s in the middle because \"a valid segment does not start with 0\". If you insist on this being correct, I recommend providing a test case to that effect. However, I think you should change it. \n\nI also think this is a bad game mode for reverse. If you want the puzzle to be simplified and suitable for reverse mode, I recommend simply providing the input as 8-bit integers separated by spaces, and the first input be the number of said integers.",
