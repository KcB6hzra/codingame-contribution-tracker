    "content": "there is one issue... I just had this in fastest clash and ended up behind everybody else although submitting first, just because validator has time-outed. I was using Python3, the guy who submitted after me did exactly the same, only instead of \"any([a, b, c])\" he did \"a or b or c\". Best thing about this is that tests also passed. I really do not consider this different algorithm that should cause a time-out... What about making the biggest validator and test a bit lower for it would depend less on coincidence?",

    "content": "One curious thing is that a lot of languages time out with a translation of your code. It makes sense than something like python does time out (for the two largest ones),  but C and C++ also times out (for the largest one). I've got no idea why this should be, java shouldn't survive an equivalent C/C++ implementation. Maybe a server issue? Are time constraints different for different languages?\n\nAlso, your largest test also invalidates your input constraint. I would recommend adding asserts in your test code that actually checks that the constraints are fulfilled.",
