But it backfires time to time and this puzzle is one of them, it backfires so hard. I believe that it's solvable under 15 mins if read carefully. I can turn it to a classic puzzle if many people complain about its hardness. But tbh, it'd be way too easy for a classic puzzle. I feel like it's in-between",

But great contribution, tho. Hope it gets accepted.",
