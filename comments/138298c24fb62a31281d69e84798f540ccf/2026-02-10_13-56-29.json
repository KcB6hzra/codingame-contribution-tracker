    "content": "I agree, it's hard to define exactly what's the \"most evenly spread\" team.\n\nThere are several ways to evaluate that but the most common would be to minimize the variance.\nHere's what you can find on Wikipédia about the variance :\n\"In probability theory and statistics, variance measures how far a set of numbers is spread out. A variance of zero indicates that all the values are identical. Variance is always non-negative: a small variance indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean (expected value) and hence to each other, while a high variance indicates that the data points are very spread out around the mean and from each other.\"\nI thought it would be a fairly easy exercice, as the variance is a tool that you usually encounter in high school.\n\nIf you don't know what the variance is, or if you want to look at this problem from another angle you may want to simply minimize the sum of the deviations from the mean.\nIf you apply this method, it's true that you may get a different result.\nBut here, I made the test cases so that it would give you the same result.\n\nAs for the REVERSE statement, I agree that it could be too difficult and I changed it.",
