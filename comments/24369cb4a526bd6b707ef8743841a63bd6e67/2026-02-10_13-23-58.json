    "content": "I just got this clash, and I do not understand it. Probably I overlook something.\n\nWhat is S2(2,0) (for example)? I needed it for my approach in simply finding first all S2 for n=1-25 and k=1-25. Then, at some point, I need to know S2(3,1), and S2(3,1) is calculated partly based on S2(3-1,1-0) = S2(2,0).\n-- or can I in that case consistently base S2(2,0) partly on S2(1,-1) -- which is 1 because n is 1 in that case? [oh shit that is probably it]",
