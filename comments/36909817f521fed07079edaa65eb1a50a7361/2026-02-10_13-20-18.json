    "content": "Thanks for the feedback! I went ahead and revised the description to make the connections between contrast and relative luminance a bit clearer.\n\nAs for using loopline in the stub, I am not seeing how to make a clean stub with that command, but it's probably just me, since it's my first time contributing here. I would assume it would be something like this: \n\nloopline 1 red:int green:int blue:int \nloopline 1 red2:int green2:int blue2:int\n\nor\n\nloopline 2 red:int green:int blue:int\n\nbut both seem pretty messy compared to the string input I had before. Any thoughts?\n\nEDIT: \nI switched it to a read command that reads the three ints on two lines instead of the string based input I had before. This seems cleaner than the loopline commands, but again, maybe I am missing something there.",

Now you just have to add [[C]] in the Output section so that it is properly defined.\n\n(Just to explain a bit: I understand that the Goal section states C, but it reads more like a formula and it does not contain the R, G, B variables either. That's why I make the above suggestion.)",
