    "content": "For me, \"a game of Hangman\" has a very specific set of rules:\n- a single player guesses letters of a word/phrase\n- whenever an incorrect letter is guessed, a line is added to a drawing of a stick figure being hanged\n- if the drawing is completed before the whole word is guessed (maybe 10 or 11 lines), the player loses\n\nYour letter-guessing game is similar, but not the same. I'm concerned that this could cause confusion. \n\nAfter reading the statement through once, I *think* I understand the rules, but I'm not 100% sure. Having to re-read the (fairly lengthy) statement is not great for a CoC.\n\nEdit (after solving):\n- My understanding of the rules was correct (I didn't need to re-read the statement)\n- There are no test cases where Alice and Bob have the same score. I'm not sure if the output should be Alice 0 (because Alice goes first) or something else. I suggest including \"Alice and Bob will never take the same number of guesses to reveal the word\".\n- I don't believe *your* solution can be coded in 5 minutes :P",

Changing the phrasing to \"a game kind of like Hangman\" would not be an improvement; everyone who knows the gist of Hangman should understand what's going on, and those unfamiliar won't have their judgment clouded by preconceived notions.\n\nI would have trouble believing you if you said it took you more than a minute to read the entire thing.",
