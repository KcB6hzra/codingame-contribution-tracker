    "content": "I just got this one as Reverse, and I could only do it because I had seen this one during the approval stage and remembered the point (that it was a cycle of n%4).\n\nI think reverse mode should be removed, because it would have not been doable with the current cases. There are only 6 cases visible for reverse players, and from those 6 you have to abstract a total number of 4 possible outputs.\n\nAnd, I think approvers do not always check whether reverse mode is activated and what they think about that, before approving.",
