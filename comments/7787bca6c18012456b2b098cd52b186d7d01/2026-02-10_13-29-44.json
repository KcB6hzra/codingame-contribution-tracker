You need a little math background to solve it, but nothing impossible with Google ;)\n\nIf you correct the following things, I give you my vote :\n\n-\n\n1 - Description:\n----------------------\nThe description needs to mention the fact that each line ends by a space.\n\n-\n\n2 - Tests:\n-------------\nYou have put the constraint 2<N<1000, so we can guess than, even if we need to divide each node by prime numbers, they won't be bigger than square root of 1000 (which is ~31).\nSo, we must test to divide each node by {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31}.\nYour problem can actually be solved using only the four first prime numbers {2, 3, 5, 7}.\nYou should add a number using \"big\" prime numbers under srqt(1000).\n\nFor exemple :\n\nInput:\n969\n\nOutput\n3 323 \n3 17 19 \n\nor\n\nInput:\n741\n\nOutput:\n3 247 \n3 13 19",
