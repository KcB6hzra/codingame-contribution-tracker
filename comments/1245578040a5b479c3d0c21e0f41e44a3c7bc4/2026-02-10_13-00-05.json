Better yet, add a space after all x-coordinates too (this latter suggestion also applies to paragraph 1 and the formula near the end).\n\n* Formula near the end: Please format \"cx\" and \"cy\" as [[variables]].\n\nOutput\n* Please change \"[[height+2]]\" and \"[[width+2]]\" to \"[[height]]+2\" and \"[[width]]+2\" respectively.\n\nConstraints\n* Please change \"w\" and \"h\" to \"width\" and \"height\" respectively.\n\nStub generator\n* Please change \"x\" and \"y\" to \"cx\" and \"cy\" respectively.\n\n* Suggest to delete \"loop height\" to avoid confusion (there should be height + 2 rows instead).\n\nCover picture\n* Suggest to upload a cover picture for the puzzle.\n\nCases\n* Validator 4: The case name is missing.\n\n* Please split the last pair of cases into two pairs, as Test 8 is the only case where the ring's center has negative coordinates.\n\n* Please add some more pairs of cases where the ring's center has negative coordinates (and in some of these cases the ring is actually a disc).\n\n* Please add some cases where the ring's center has a mix of positive and negative coordinates (both +x, –y and –x, +y, in separate pairs of cases) (and in some of these cases the ring is actually a disc).\n\nThanks.",
