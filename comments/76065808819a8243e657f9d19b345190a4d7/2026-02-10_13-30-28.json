    "content": "I think it's much clearer now. I canceled my rejection, which also removed your comment below saying you addressed the points we raised, sorry for that.\n\nI'm being quite annoying, but I still think you should add white spaces to make every line equally long; or you should at least say that the lines have different length, and that they must be aligned to the left. Normally ASCII representations form a [height] x [width] picture, so people will assume this, and there is no obvious convention on the alignment (I could also form a different picture by aligning the same lines to the right!)",

    "content": "I agree. At the moment the input description \"amount of space separated trees\" does not correspond to the actual input (the height of the ASCII representation). You should also specify what one finds line by line. The description could be something like:\n<<Line 1:>> an integer [[t]], the time in months\n<<Line 2:>> etc.\n<<Line 3:>> etc.\n<<Next [[h]] lines:>> the ASCII representation of the trees \n\nI also think that it would be better to have the same number of characters [[w]] on each line (filling them with spaces when necessary) and give [[w]] as input as well. This seems logical since the lines represent an overall picture.",
