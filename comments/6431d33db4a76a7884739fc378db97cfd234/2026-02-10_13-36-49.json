In each case it took at least 10 minutes. So this is likely to be challenging just to complete in time.\n\nMaybe give a hint to steer in the direction of dot product? I would also suggest not using zero coordinates in so many of your test cases, as it tends to pass too easily if the formulas aren't set up right. Limit to the first case.",
