    "content": "Goal\n* In the first paragraph, suggest to add \"(see definition below)\" after the first time \"checkout\" is mentioned. I don't play darts, and I don't know what checkout means, so I was confused until I saw the definition below.\n\n* I don't understand \"Double 3 and Treble 2 are not considered equal values\". Do you mean they are different ways of giving the same score? The values of the products of 2 x 3 and 3 x2 look equal to me.\n\n* The values listed are:\nSingles: 1, 2, 3, …\nDoubles: 2, 4, 6, …\nTrebles: 3, 6, 9, …\nSo these are the values *after* applying a multiplier? I'm confused as you then give the examples of \"Double 3\" and \"Treble 2\" while \"3\" does not appear in the list of doubles and \"2\" does not appear in the list of trebles.\n\nCode\n* Line 25: I think you mean BFS instead of BSF.\n\nStub generator\n* Please add a write statement.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "Point 2: Trying to explain that D3 and T2 both have values of 6 but are considered different as they're in different segments. I.e. 6 could be D2 or T3 - so if the checkout route was 6 -> 2, it could be T2 D1 or D3 D1, they're two routes and not the same, despite having the same value.\n\nPoint 3: Changed to the *name* of the value and mentioned doubles are 2x and trebles are 3x, with an example. \n\nHopefully the changes have made it clearer. If it still isn't clear, let me know!\n\n1, 4 and 5 are sorted. Thanks!",
