    "content": "This statement is currently quite confusing.\n\n\"This game must have exactly 3 players. They decide to team up in trios and play the game. After each game the trios are rearranged. Sometimes there will be some players that will not be able to play in each round of games. But, if everyone can play in each round of games, that day is called a Lucky Day.\"\n\nIt might be clearer if you say:\n\"They decide to team up in trios and play multiple games simultaneously in rounds.\"\n\nNot a bad clash once you can figure it out, but in my clash I was the only human to get above 0%.\nUnfortunately I got 80% because of Validator 3. I had 100% on the tests, but I was using factorials and \"nCr = n!/(r!(n-r)!)\" which had an issue for n = 3 since \"n-r=0\" and my factorial was poorly defined for 0.",
