It might bring some more confusion or problems with some languages (the \\u syntax is not quite universal I presume). Maybe using an ASCII character instead would be better?\n\n* Personally I got confused once by the fact that a single test uses several lock types. I did not realize I had solved the first type because the second one was failing. Given the difficulty, it would also be more encouraging to get something green each time. It's fine to have multiple locks at the end, after all types have been introduced, to check success was not accidental.",

    "content": "00:00 how can I found the solution to puzzles, if I have no clues, I'm on ss_f and this is a serie of 6 following letter 5 upper, 1 lower (can be anywhere) and i need to print an int. I tried to print the value of the lower letter, to add all ascii values, to capitalize every char, and add it... I'm out of idea.\n\n00:15 finally, that was not the value, but the index. It could be nice to have the solution if we fail. just to have an idea of what to do, or just an interval in the statement. now... rs_f\n\n00:45 on gs_m this time. what does \"str, 2\" mean. what is the output format ? \"str\" ok, I can figure what it is, but what is this \"2\" ? 2 strings (or symbol) are waited ? the number have to be printed ? and if there is 2 things to print, what is the format. Are they separated by \", \" or \" \" or \"\\n\". I'm sure this puzzle is awesome. But it's really frustrating to trample on (sorry for the litteral translation of french expression)\n\n00:50 And again, what is the symbol needed ? I tried ascii, the index of the number in \"Need symbol: X\" (modulo the length), but no clue\n\n01:00 (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻\n\n01:35 sorry... ┬━┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)\nI repeat, to not be misinterpreted, the puzzle is really interesting, the structure is good and the challenge is in the restricted information. just let me get mad about this frustrating #@!#?#@. If you like headache, it's for you. Anyway I upvoted it, and I will continue to tear off my hair to find my own solution (can be a good teamwork :D).\n\n01:45 I'll continue to tell my (boring) story. I'm still on gs_m. I tried to print the symbol of the number (always +) and \", 2\". So I printed \"+, 2\". Surprisingly, it didn't work. Also print the number (modulo 26) as the index in alphabet, lower and upper case, separated by \" \"|\",\"|\", \"|\"\\n\"|\"\" and then upper and lower. Didn't work too. Ascii don't work.\nNext idea: On my way to find one\n\n01:55 let's think, the test is named lookup table. It's probably not the ascii table. So which other conversion table from int to string/char does exist ?\n\n02:10 thanks Fluttershy for the help. So the answer is an Uppercase and a lowercase (lowercase can be missing) not separated\n\n02:25 Fluttershy was right...\nノ┬─┬ノ ︵ ( o°o)\n\n03:00 still didn't give up\n\n03:10 fu** it I'm out... I will do the others tests then come back to gs_m/ss_m\n\n03:30 I finally finished the conversion table from ascii art. How will I implement it now? Split by space columns seems good, but it will cause problems with 6 and 8. Thinking time.\n\n03:32 and I'm on ss_asc\n\n03:40 Maybe I found a mistake in the puzzle. To the end of the last line in ascii art, spaces are removed. It can be hard to deal with it in many languages, because, the concversion table have spaces. To pass through I only use the 3 first lines of each number. But it's just a trick\n\n04:00 Ascii finished :D to deal with the missing spaces, I just added the difference of spaces from first to last line. But I still think only the 3 first lines of numbers can be used (confirmed by test).",
