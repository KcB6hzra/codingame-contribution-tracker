So nice python !",

Neither of these are deal-breakers; it is certainly possible to solve without these changes. It just may be frustrating to some solvers without those hints.",

To this end, I've made the first example small enough it can be worked by hand.\n\nIf you have suggestions how I can guide people better, I can add them.
