    "content": "This is completely impossible to solve in 5 minutes.\nSolving in 15 would require someone who has done this before or someone who has looked up a solution online.\n\nThere is no way this is a fun clash.\n\nYour own code is 37 lines when you properly indent it (removing the semi-colon and colon hacks that allowed you to golf it to 27 lines).\n\nEven knowing your whole solution, I doubt you could re-write it from scratch in 10 minutes. Expecting people to solve this in 15 minutes is madness. Clashes are meant to be feasibly solvable in 5 minutes.\n\nThis should have been a puzzle, not a clash. I feel terrible for anyone who gets this as a clash. Even reading the description will take 4-5 minutes. Then figuring out where to start and trying it out will take up to 10, there's no time for debugging if anything goes wrong... This is just not fair, I can't believe no one rejected it...",
