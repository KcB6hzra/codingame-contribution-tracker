    "content": "Goal section\n* Please change “the color of your child’s eyes” to “the most probable color of the child’s eyes” (added two words and changed one word).\n\n* Suggest to change “possible matches” to “possible combinations” or  “possible cases”.\n\n* Please change “the color of the parents’s” to “the colors of the parents’” (two words changed).\n\n* Please format “Blue”, “Brown”, “Green” as {{constants}} instead of [[variables]].\n\n* I suggest to rewrite the longest two paragraphs as the following 4 paragraphs:\n\nIf the colors of the parents’ eyes are the same, it is certain that their child’s eyes will inherit the same color.\n\nIf the parents’ eyes are {{Green}} and {{Brown}}, there is a higher probability that their child’s eyes are {{Brown}}.\n\nIn all other cases, there is a chance of around 50% of inheriting the eye color from either parent. You should assume that every odd-indexed child born (index = 1, 3, 5, etc.) will get the color from the first parent, and every even-indexed child (index = 0, 2, 4, 6, etc.) will get the color from the second parent.\n\nNote that indexing starts with {{0}}.\n\n* Suggest to change “Matches :” to “Below is a summary of the possible cases:”\n\n* Please delete “to [[N]]” (as in “odd to N”).\n\n* Please delete “to [[N]] , ” (as in “even to N”).\n\n(Reason: N is a fixed constant. We do not check whether N is odd or even. In your solution code, you are checking whether i (index) is odd or even.)\n\nOutput section\n* Please change “your child” to “the child of each parent of parents, in the same order as input”\n\n(By the way, jokingly, I won’t be able to bear 100 children, and my eyes won’t change colors every time a child is born! So no way they are my children :wink: )\n\nThanks.",
