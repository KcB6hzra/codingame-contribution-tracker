    "content": "Hey. I just got this in a clash an won with 16%, 5/6 people got 0%, some just left the clash straight away.\n\nIt's quite a hard one. Combining a lot of string manipulation with non-trivial, conditional calculations that then need to be formatted with the dreaded 1000's separator (my least favourite part to solve, haha).\n\nAlso, it's a bit unclear what you mean by 'shown to 2 decimal places' as this could mean truncate or round, or even ceil.\nTest 2 is particularly hard for this since:\n9.25*0.9*2*(8+11)*1.5 = 474.525\nWhich you round to 474.53, but sprintf (at least in Ruby) rounds it to $474.52.\n\nIt took me about 10 minutes just to solve the base problem and start working on 1000's separators, then when I started getting errors (forgot to multiply by costPer in walls condition), I had no time to debug.\n\nI recommend removing the formatting for the answer and just allowing it to be a rounded float.\nAlso, just giving the height as a float rather than a string. These seem like unnecessary hurdles to make an already tricky challenge even harder.",

So \"floor dimensions\" are provided no matter the upgrade work is done to walls or floors. Do I have to figure out \"wall dimensions\" myself? Do I have to assume the number of walls to upgrade? 1? 2? 3? 4? Do I always assume walls and floors are rectangular? (My bedroom does not have rectangular walls and floors.) It may be better to explain more in Goal section.\n\nThanks.",
