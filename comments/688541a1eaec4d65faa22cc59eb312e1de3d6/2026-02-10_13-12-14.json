When the two letters are  the same \"m and M\", the capital M will go before the lowercase m. \nAfter it is alphabetically sorted, the second input describes the order. In the example I showed previously, the pattern is 21345. Since \"M\" is the second letter in \"fMmor\", it is displayed first. \"f\" is the first letter so it  is displayed next. Then the third, fourth, and finally fifth. Leading to the output: Mfmor\nI hope this resolves your issue. I will try to make my actual description easier to understand.",
