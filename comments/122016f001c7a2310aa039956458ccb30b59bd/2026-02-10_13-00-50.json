    "content": "The constraints state 1 <= N <= 100 but there are no tests nor validators with N==100.\n\nThis is annoying in Shortest Mode, because 100 has more bytes than lower numbers, so using 100 as an upper bound instead of 99 in the code costs one byte.\n\nSince there are no visible tests with n==100, the clasher has to gamble on whether there are any hidden validators with n==100 or not.\n* If I write 100 in my code, I might lose by one byte to another clasher who wrote 99 instead,\n* if I write 99 in my code, I might lose by having less than 100% on the validators.\n\nI suggest either adding a Test and a Validator with n==100, or changing the constraints so they match the reality of tests and validators.",

    "content": "Nice clash idea, but it's a bit confusing currently.\n\n* The main confusing thing is that the \"crimes\" that each person commits contains integers that don't appear in either the \"laws\" or \"severeLaws\" lists. So it would be good to make that clear somewhere in the statement. Also, would be good to rename this in the stub generator to something like \"acts\" or \"actions\".\n\n* Also, in the stub generator the minor crimes list is named \"laws\" and the felonies list is named \"severeLaws\", but this doesn't match the statement at all. It's best to use the same variable names as the statement to make things easier. I'd suggest changing \"laws\" to \"minorCrimes\" and \"severeLaws\" to \"felonies\", then in the Input section putting \"minor crimes\" as \"[[minor crimes]]\" and same for \"felonies\", so they are clearly shown as variables.\n\n* Lastly, I'd re-write the input as below for more clarity:\n<<Line 1:>> Integers separated by spaces for [[minor crimes]], like pickpocketing.\n<<Line 2:>> Integers separated by spaces for [[felonies]], like arson.\n<<Line 3:>> [[N]], the number of people to be sentenced.\n<<Next [[N]] lines:>> [[acts]], integers separated by spaces for what each person has done (may have repeating values and values which are neither crimes nor felonies)",

The solution correctly differentiates between minor crimes and felonies, applying the appropriate sentence length for each. The program is clear, and it follows the requirements for computing the total sentence, ensuring accuracy and correctness in handling various crime scenarios.",

    "content": "The problem is easy to understand and solve, however, I believe there are something you could do to make the statement clearer. \n\n* Keep the names of the crime the same throughout. Perhaps you could use misdemeanour and felony to represent illegal things/stuff and exception/EXTRA illegal thing/stuff respectively? \n\n* Put the conditions of how many years of sentence each crime should get in bullet point, i.e.: \n   -   Give the accused person 1 year of sentence for every misdemeanour they commit\n   -   Give the accused person 6 years of sentence for every felony they commit\n\n* Remove the examples in your input - your example test case have already covered that.\n\n* Change \"numbers\" to \"integers\" in your input and output\n\nHere is my solution in Python: \n\nlaws = input().split()\nsevere_laws = input().split()\nn = int(input())\nfor i in range(n):\n    x = 0\n    crimes = input().split()\n    for j in crimes: \n        if j in laws: \n            x += 1 \n        elif j in severe_laws: \n            x+=6\n    print(x)\n\nWell done!",
