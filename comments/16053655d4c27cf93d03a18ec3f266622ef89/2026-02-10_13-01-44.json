Is it the top-left corner of the board, or the bottom-left one?\n\n* It sounds like each move must be in a single direction. The directions are not really necessary, because only the destination coordinates are required to be output. Suggest to change the *FIRST* sentence of \"Movements\" to:\n\nDuring a player's turn, the player may either keep their token in its current location, or move it to another cell up to 3 steps away (measured in Manhattan distance).\n\n* Suggest to change \"a cell with\" to \"a cell occupied by\".\n\n* Please change \"map\" to \"board\" (twice).\n\n* It sounds like a player can only build a wall after moving their token. Suggest to change the *FIRST* sentence of \"Wall building\" to:\n\nAfter completing their move – or choosing not to move – the player must build a wall on any side of their token: <const>U</const>p, <const>D</const>own, <const>L</const>eft, or <const>R</const>ight.\n\n* Please change \"of both parties\" to \"player's token\".\n\n* Please change \"another wall\" to \"an existing wall\".\n\n* Suggest to change \"see what will happen\" to \"learn what happens\".\n\n* Please change \"attempted\" to \"attempt\".\n\n* Suggest to change \"do it\" to \"do so\".\n\n* Suggest to change \"one player can never\" to \"neither player can\".\n\n* Please change \"reach to\" to \"reach\".\n\n* What does this mean? \"Note that the rule with player blocking a cell by standing on it does not count in this condition.\"\n\nSay, if a player builds four walls to block off all the sides where their token is located, then it should still be a \"game over\" because neither player can reach the other player…?\n\n* Please add the sections of Victory Conditions and Defeat Conditions. Please check out the HTML source of any bot programming games for an example.\n\nExpert Rules\n* Please change \"another\" to \"an\".\n\n* Please change \"wall build\" to \"wall building\".\n\n* Please change \"there's an empty space\" to \"an available side is found\".\n\nExample\n* Is this section required, or can it be removed?\n\nNote\n* Is this section required, or can it be removed?\n\nInitial input\n* Please add \"Two space-separated integers\" before \"width\".\n\nInput\n* Line 1: Please add \"2 space-separated integers\".\n\n* Line 1: Please change \"your position\" to \"the position of your token\".\n\n* Line 2: Please add \"2 space-separated integers\".\n\n* Line 2: Please change \"opponent's position\" to \"the position of your opponent's token\".\n\n* Line 3: Please add \"An integer\".\n\n* Next numWalls lines:\n\n  • Please add \"4 space-separated integers\".\n  \n  • Please change \"both\" to \"the\".\n\n  • Please change \"on top or on the left\" to \"above or to the left\".\n\nOutput\n* Please change \"the cell you wish to go to\" to \"the position of the cell you wish to move your token to (or its current position if not moving)\".\n\n* Please delete \"after moving to x y\" because a token may not necessarily move.\n\nThanks.",

So, how could I've phrased it better?\n\n> Say, if a player builds four walls to block off all the sides where their token is located, then it should still be a \"game over\" because neither player can reach the other player…?\nPrecisely\n\n> Please delete \"after moving to x y\" because a token may not necessarily move.\nI just want to emphasize on the fact that the wall build action is AFTER the move, but I guess the statement before already made it clear enough.",

    "content": "Hi, thanks for the comment, and sorry for the awfully late response, was kinda busy.\n\nLast time, the game is actually more forgiving, the referee will actually fix your wall placement if you placed a direction with a wall already occupied, and will let you stay in place if you try to move to somewhere out of range. But apparently it's not normal to have this feature, so I changed it.\n\nI personally don't like a \"WAIT\" move. I much prefer to have a system that will force the player to make a move every single turn, which in my opinion what makes this game interesting. In some moves where wall placement is not the main goal, players still have to figure out the most optimal \"waiting\" wall placement to not mess up future planning.\n\nThe best I can do to fulfil your wish is to provide a random command, which can easily allow players like you to test and see what will happen after hitting the \"Play my code\" button, but I'm not sure if I'm motivated enough to do that. I might do it if more people have the same demand. You can always create a pull request if you want to implement the feature yourself.",

    "content": "> The directions are not really necessary\n>> I emphasize on the steps because of walls, there will be cases where the cell seem to be within 3-step Manhattan distance yet still unreachable due to a wall blocking it.\nI still believe the directions are not necessary because the wall blocking rule applies no matter you talk about directions or Manhattan distance. The player should read the instructions as a whole, instead of focusing on individual sentences. I highly recommend to remove the notion of directions here to remove confusion with the direction of building a wall.\n\nFor the other question I'll have a think first.",

You may also consider adding \"(domain)\" after \"cells\".\n\n* With reference to the scenario you mentioned, my suggested wording is:\n\nNote that a player does not lose simply because their token is surrounded by 3 walls and blocked by the other player's token on the fourth side.\n\nDefeat Condition\n* Please change \"less\" to \"fewer\".\n\nOutput\n* As mentioned, please delete \"after moving to x y\" because a token may not necessarily move.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "For the \"scenario\", I just realise that I'm just confusing myself, and already found a better way of wording, which is the current one. For the \"cell\" to \"cells\", I actually mean it that way, the win condition is determined by whether one player can reach the cell the other player is CURRENTLY standing at. By mentioning this it automatically clears the confusion of the \"scenario\" because in the scenario the player can still reach each other.\n\nTLDR, as long as an unobstructed path exist between two players, the game continues.\n\nThe other corrections should be done, hopefully I didn't miss any, thanks again.",
