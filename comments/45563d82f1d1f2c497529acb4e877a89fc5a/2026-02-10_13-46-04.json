    "content": "Too long for a clash.\n\nIn \"fastest\" mode, everyone will start by writing a simple iterative function to track the position. Mine (N goes to L-1-N, L goes to L-1) passed all but the \"godzilla\" case. \nWriting and debugging this takes a few minutes, which doesn't leave much time to approach the problem anew as a math puzzle.\n\nAt least change your hint to explicitly state that a mathematical solution will be necessary. I thought you were warning against tracking the entire array when we only care about one position.",

    "content": "I think it would be a pretty good clash if u get rid of the monster and godzilla case. The mathematical solution would be good for shortest and for fastest people could find a different way by implementing the transformation.\n\nBut with these two validators you must find the logical/mathematical solution, which I think is too hard to find just by the given example. I think clashes like this mustn't have only 1 right solution. It is not fun to get a working solution to get crushed because someone wants to force a solution. Forcing a solution would be more suitable for a puzzle than a clash.",
