I'm not an expert, but usually around my level, I got Clashes which takes almost 15 minutes for all my seniors to do, and this is clearly much-much simpler, because it is basically just a \"what are your divisors\" question, with some ifs at the end, doing from scratch, without overthinking. So mos def not hitting the 10 minute mark.\n\nI can explain it more clearly in the text, that is a valid point.",

The only difference here is that this Clash adds a twist, so it is not just 45 second for somebody, but they actually need some thinking to how to actually do it.\nI get it, that it is harder than many of the clashes, but sadly when I do an easy one, the moderators rejecting them for being too easy :)",
