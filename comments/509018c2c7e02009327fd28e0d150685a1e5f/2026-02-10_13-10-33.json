Oh sh*t, they can go over punctuation as well. Oh sh*t, they can overlap). I should probably learn regular expressions to get fastest with this one.",

    "content": "Pff this one was challenging due to the fact that I do not know regular expressions too well so I did it without. Assuming that most coders should know about regular expressions this clash should be doable.\n\nI did at some point have code that did not pass the 'Overlapping matches' test & validator, and it also not passed the 'Big one' validator BUT it passed the 'Big one' test. That means there is imbalance between your Big one test and validator (I assume because in the validator there is an overlap issue, while that is not in the test). I suggest you to change the 'Big one' test to add also one overlap case in there - it makes sense that if a player fails the 'Overlapping matches', he/she should also fail the final test.",
