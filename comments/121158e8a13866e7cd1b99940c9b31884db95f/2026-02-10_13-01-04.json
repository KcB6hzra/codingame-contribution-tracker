    "content": "It's possible. I can think of three options. Starting from line 3:\n\n1. Add a stick-man in lines 3 to 5 (as part of the write statement - it supports a multi-line argument, so you don't have to repeat \"write\" every time).\n\n2. Add a STATEMENT block and a stick-man.\n\n3. Add an OUTPUT block and a stick-man.\n\nFor options 2 and 3 you may refer to the examples here: https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/stub-generator",

    "content": "I read the documentation you provided and tried your options.\nThere is just a tiny problem. Apparently, text inserted through stub generator ends up trimmed. That means, I can't properly comment that a stick-man's head is \" o \" because it ends up as \"o\". I tried the `write join(\" o \")` function, but the following `write`s were inserting extra \"auto-generated code\" comments.\n\nI think it's better to keep things simple and leave the Goal as it is.\n\nThank you, 5DN1L.",
