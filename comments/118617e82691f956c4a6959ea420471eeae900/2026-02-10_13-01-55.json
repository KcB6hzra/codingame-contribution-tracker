    "content": "Working on this in PHP.  Can't get more than 6 out of 9 cases nor validators online.  The most expensive part of my code is copying the board $tb=unserialize(serialize($b)); (a full 2 dim board) which is done for example 154,265 times on case 6 - Glass.  If i could fit the biggest board in 63 bits I'm sure i could do it.  Traditionally my depth searches can't go past depth 9, especially with this width - so that tracks with expectations.  I think I can make it better, but for the time expenditure to do so ... it should be hard and worth more xp imo.  there are some tricks to pull off DFS, the overhead of any other alg is too much imo that add undue complexity.  if you scan the board in a diagonal fashion you can pre-setup \"fit\" placement.  For example, Glass has 715 such total placements over the 9 pieces.  if you have x,y you can clearly see how any cell x+a,y+b is dependent on x,y, so pre-tabling by x,y on diagonals should be efficient.  And if letters are reassigned from largest to smallest pieces IFCEGJLBNDMAKH , the distribution of those letters over all 715 is 88,37,0,58,56,60,56,0,142,0,68,150,0,0 with the first trial as I @ 0,0.  Considering there are multiple possible solutions, reducing the open board space first makes sense.  Bad future moves are easily skipped if a condition like if (($bv|$cv)==$bv) { } isn't satisfied.  However that brings up the second most expensive function, grabbing the mask value from the board... which is called 786,681 times ... again just grabbing 16 bits from a 2d board and comparing to the piece orientation bitset.  Since order of placement doesn't matter, i can see dancing around and hashing compatible and incompatible moves ... but I can't visualize the expense v. savings since moves can be skipped so easily.  I'll try to more linearize the board and adjust the foundational bit twiddling, but I doubt I can solve all 9 online in php.  Since php stores strings more efficiently than arrays i tried changing the mb_internal_encoding, but still requires a conversion step before any comparisons are made.  So while copying less memory each time is more efficient the coding and decoding seems to be still be done at a 7-bit level internally and you lose any speed gains.  A 1dim array of height+4 would be required to streamline the board to its best available format, which i'll try next.  I type too much, but i think limiting the pieces to a total of 9 per case would solve the issue of slow langs.  And thanks for not making it more than 1 piece being possible per case.  yes, coding is fun.  overthinking, not so much.",

It does exit early if it finds a solution.\n\nI'm not surprised the DLX passes, which is good news nevertheless, I just wonder if this can be done with just DFS / recursion as claimed by the tags. It is very possible that the intended solution by OP is just more optimized than what I did. It boils to what he had in mind.",

    "content": "@VizGhar\n\nI have not much experience with Solo puzzles, but it seems to me that the general consensus in I/O puzzles is that validators need to test for a similar scenario as their counterpart public tests.\n\nThe only real suggestion I had was for easier tests at the very beginning (position 2, 3), since the gap between Sample and First Aid Kit is quite noticeable. Maybe something with A, B, C to test for piece construction at the same time.\n\nThe timeout question is entirely dependent to what you have in mind for an expected solution. If you are expecting DLX, then maybe revisit the tags and call it a day. If you think it should be solvable within that time limit with some DFS, then I'm presenting you a decently optimized (not completely, it lacks at least a couple things I have in mind), that is not able to pass the last two tests.\n\nIf someone managed to solved it in python with a DFS within the 2 second limit, and you are fine with the solution they propose, they I'm fine too and I'll try to add the required optimizations.",
