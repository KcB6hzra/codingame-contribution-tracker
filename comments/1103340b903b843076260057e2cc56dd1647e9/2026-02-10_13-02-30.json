I kept going to back to the goal statement and reading the instructions over and over. As I sit here with a finished algorithm, I wonder why I made it as difficult as I did. The step-by-step algorithm now seem very clear. I believe this puzzle demonstrates how difficult it can be sometimes (for some of us) to translate clear instructions to code.\n\nThe test case design is well done and it helped me quite a bit to work my way to a full solution. When I failed a later test case, I almost wrote a question on the contribution page, but then I checked the goal statement one more time and my answer was right there.",

    "content": "I'll grant you, the part that describes the oracle is longer than necessary. After Simon's problem is defined, the illustration isn't absolutely necessary either, but without it you'd have to read Wikipedia to put it all together. That problem is complicated enough that Wikipedia might be helpful even with. But then the oracle description takes two paragraphs, and is further illustrated in a third before giving the actual problem statement. The reason I'd rather not condense this, is that the puzzle isn't meant to say anywhere how it's to be solved, rather what must be achieved by a solution. Figuring out how to do that is what makes it a hard problem. Otherwise it would be medium with too many hints and spoilers, or literally easy if I spelled out the steps that need to be taken. So I'd rather have more example and illustration than less, for those who attempt it and then get stuck and need to come back for inspiration. This is why it seems to be defined in a circuitous manner. That's deliberate. The idea of the oracle isn't just a theme, it's a useful metaphor for how your code is meant to behave, rather than a direct implementation of a stepwise problem statement. Yes, oracles are common in theory such as proofs of computational complexity. This isn't that, it isn't a proof, but it's really close to one. There's a reason 'E' can't be assigned instead of 'A' again, and it's not obvious why unless you work out the logic.",
