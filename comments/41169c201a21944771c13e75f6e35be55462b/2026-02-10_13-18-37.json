    "content": "Good clash idea, that I had almost approved until I thought about the reverse mode proposal with it. I do not feel it would lead to a good reverse mode experience under the current test sets, and for that I believe it may be better to have the list of food items in customer basket at the starting line (instead of last line) followed by violating combination counts, and the combinations following it. Still, I'm not very comfortable to see reverse mode working well with the case, so I invite you and fellow CodinGamers to give reverse mode improvement a thought for this problem before it gets accepted.",

In addition to that it was also confusing that they were next to each other in both the basket and in the 'forbidden items list'.\n\nI think you can solve this by making it more obvious that it's not a single item. For example changing first example to:\n1\npizza icecream\nicecream sausage pizza lemon",
