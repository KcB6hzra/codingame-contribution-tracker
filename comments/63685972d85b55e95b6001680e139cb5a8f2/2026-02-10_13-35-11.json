    "content": "I just had this Clash in Fastest mode. It was extremely easy. I think it must be exciting in Shortest or Reverse.\n\nInterestingly, there are apparently two ambiguities, that are reflected both in the statement and the tests and validators: \n\n1) For your function shared_letters, we can write either:\n\ndef shared_letters(a, b):\n    return any(x==y for x in a for y in b)\n\nor:\n\ndef shared_letters(a, b):\n    return any(x==y for x,y in zip(a,b)\n\nBoth versions pass all tests and validators even though they are clearly not equivalent.\n\n2) Both of these two loops pass all tests and validators, even though the checks are in different order:\n\nfor i in range(len(a)):\n    if len(a[i]) != len(b[i]): return 'some of the corresponding words not the same length'\n    if shared_letters(a[i], b[i]): return 'shared letters in corresponding words'\n\nfor i in range(len(a)):\n    if len(a[i]) != len(b[i]): return 'some of the corresponding words not the same length'\nfor i in range(len(a)):\n    if shared_letters(a[i], b[i]): return 'shared letters in corresponding words'\n\nI assume the tests and validators were designed on purpose to give more freedom for the implementation. Congrats!",

    "content": "While printing the word lengths makes the output not *entirely* binary it's still pretty much binary with a separate task of printing the word lengths. I think the problem would be more interesting if instead of \"shadow\" or \"no shadow\" you needed to print something else, like the reason they didn't shadow each other.\n\nAlso you are missing a visible test case that has words that are same size and different but share some letters (like validator 3).",

By doing so, Set 1 tests three words, and Set 2 tests two words\n» Validator #3 should contain three words, where one of the word pairs has a different word length, but at least all word pairs do not share letters\n» Set #4 is not good - it needs to be split into several sets\n» New Set #4 should have the same number of words of equal length, but the answer is \"no shadow\" because one of the word pairs shares common letters\n» New Set #5 should be \"no shadow\" because the number of words in the input sentences is different.\n» A Set #6 that tests five shadowed words could be nice, though it's probably not necessary",

You should never have edge cases in validators only, as these are usually not visible in game, and all other cases seem to indicate that s_1 and s_2 have the same number of words.\n\nA nice and simple clash otherwise.",
