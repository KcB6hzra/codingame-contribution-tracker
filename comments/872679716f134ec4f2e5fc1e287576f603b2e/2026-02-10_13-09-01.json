    "content": "Nice clash, but your tests/validators are poorly defined.\n\nIn a Fastest mode clash people often try to skim over the description to gain an advantage. It's natural for people to expect that the inputs will be positive integers, and many won't notice the \"Note\" that warns about this.\n\nIf you write code that doesn't check for negative/zero inputs, then it gets 100% on the test cases but only 66% on the validators.\n\nThis is because the only tests/validators that really check this are \"Tricky small data\" (V1) and \"Tricky negative data\" (V3). The corresponding test cases will pass, because \"Small data\" is >0 and \"Negative data\" is \"-131\" which leads to a \"NO\" answer anyway.\n\nIt would be good to add a test case that has a and b equal to one another, and an even negative number or 0, so that it gives clashers a chance to debug their code before submitting.\n\n4/8 players in my clash got caught by this issue, including me: https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/35783493736cbe64463cbed74beb70cfcf7003f",
