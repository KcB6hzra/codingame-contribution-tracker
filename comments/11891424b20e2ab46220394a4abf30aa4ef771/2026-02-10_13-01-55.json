    "content": "✅ Great problem! This challenge effectively tests key programming skills such as:\n\nData structures usage: Requires selecting the right structure (vector, map, or pair) for storing and sorting contestants' scores.\nSorting logic: Contestants must be ranked based on average scores, ensuring correct ordering even when scores are tied.\nPrecision handling: Outputs must be formatted to two decimal places, enforcing proper use of std::fixed and std::setprecision(2).\nEdge cases: Covers multiple scenarios like minimum contestants, ties, and larger datasets to validate robustness.\nImprovements? Maybe add a constraint to limit floating-point precision when reading input to prevent unnecessary rounding issues.\n\nOverall, an engaging problem that sharpens both algorithmic thinking and formatting precision!",
