It is not defined in your statement.\n\nI consider that the coordinates are the coordinates of the center of the crop and that a crop is in the circle if its center is in, it's work but I don't know if it is \"obvious\" for all.",

You are very good at this!!\n\nI fully did most of your suggestions except for the last two:\n\nI didn't add \"printed\" or \"displayed\" before \"fully\" because a spot in the Farming-Field might be mowed, then planted, then mowed, then planted, etc before being actually printed or displayed at the end.\n\nI put the part about how the circle could overflow the Farming-Field to the Goals section instead of Output section because that has to be dealt with long before Outputting.  \n\nPlease let me know any additional feedback.
