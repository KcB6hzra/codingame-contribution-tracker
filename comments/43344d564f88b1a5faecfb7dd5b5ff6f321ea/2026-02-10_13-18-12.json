The contribution looks better now!\n\nConstraints section\n* Please use [[n]] instead of [[N]] for consistency.\n\n* Also, I don't think n can be 0 (i.e. no shift is done). I would suggest to change the first ≤ to <.\n\nGoal section\n* The explanation still needs to be expanded, with at least a simple description of what the rules of the cipher are. You may refer to this contribution as an example:\n\nhttps://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/615955355e81da150427fbc22030665ef811\n\nThanks again.",
