The statement presents itself with requisite clarity, whilst the edge cases concerning indented commentary demonstrate sound judgement. The logic remains comprehensible once one discerns the purification requirements. The difficulty proves fitting for a clash - neither unduly trivial nor excessively arduous, yet amenable to resolution within proper measure.\nThe furnished example serves sufficiently to illuminate the anticipated output format. Tried by myself and successed.",
