    "content": "I do love the idea. \nIt is however way too difficult for REVERSE.\n\nI don't see the reason of simplification for SHORTEST. Adding a third sort by time isn't changing the puzzle. I think you should commit to the idea.  \n\nMaybe it is because I'm not a native english speaker but I found the goal section a bit confusing. I think the following is correct and clearer:\n- If type is FASTEST or REVERSE the player that needed less time for solution is on top\n- If type is SHORTEST the player that has shorter solution  is on top",

    "content": "Goal section\n* The first point should be \"FASTEST or REVERSE\" instead of \"FASTER or SHORTER\".\n\n* The second point should be \"SHORTEST\" instead of \"SHORTER\". Please also change \"smaller\" to \"shorter\". Then please mention less time is better in the case of same code length.\n\n* Please mention that all the given [[time]]s are measured in seconds.\n\nInput section\n* Please change \"1. line\" to \"line 1\".\n\n* Please remove the quotation marks.\n\n* Please change \"2. line\" to \"line 2\".\n\n* Suggest not to mention \"i-th\", the various values should be formatted as [[variables]] instead of {{constants}}, variable types should be mentioned, and the variable names should be consistent throughout all the sections including the stub generator. So:\n\n<<next [[n]] lines:>> Each line includes the data for one player: [[name]] [[score]] [[time]] [[size]] separated by spaces. [[score]], [[time]] and [[size]] are all non-negative integers.\n\nOutput section\n* Please revise the format and wording, similar to my last comment. Please also mention \"separated by spaces\".\n\nConstraints section\n* I think n can never be 1 in real life? But it's up to you for the purpose of this clash.\n\n* 2nd to 4th constraints: Please format the [[variables]], and also use the same names as in above sections.\n\nThanks.",
