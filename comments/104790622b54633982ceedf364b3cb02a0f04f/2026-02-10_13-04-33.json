    "content": "It took me a while to understand the first example. It's illustrated well, but the rule could be specified more clearly, for example: \"Two integers of opposite sign are used to represent each doll.\" It also took me a while to understand the second example because there were two sets of 3's and two sets of 1's, and it wasn't clear which doll was encapsulating which. I would suggest something simpler as an example, such as -9 -3 -2 2 3 -5 -2 2 5 9. Then when you refer to the #3 and #5 dolls it's not ambiguous, yet it's also clear that there can legitimately be dolls of the same size within the problem.",

    "content": "One caveat I have with this is that you could manage to pass the first test with this faulty logic (expires in one week): https://bpa.st/5PZSM\n\nAnd then in test #2 you will find yourself alone with a very daunting:\n\nFailure\nFound: 1\nExpected: 2\n\nIn a list of 100 numbers that are between -1 and 3, making isolating the faulty line very difficult.\n\nFor the record it was this one that I failed (or maybe some other line before, for all I know). I got lucky that it happened at the end.\n\n1\n-9 -7 -3 3 -2 2 7 9\n\nThis is not a requirement but if you want to make the puzzle easier to debug I'd suggest to add another round of 11 or so easy tests after the first one, where it is clearer to see the faulty line if that ever happens. Potentially including the line above.\n\nI know now what my code was lacking, and while I don't think it is strictly necessary, I would write in \"bold\" the word solid in both:\n> The size #1 doll is a solid wood\n> count how many solid dolls are in the set.\nsince this is personally the piece of information that got away from me. This again, of course, is also up to preference.\n\nAnd I agree with the Medium difficulty. Nice puzzle.",
