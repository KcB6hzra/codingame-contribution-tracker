    "content": "Good topic, but there are sadly some important things that need to be fixed before approval.\n\nParameter W is useless if it is always 5. Should be removed and stated as a constant  \nRow testcase should be the same as example in text.\nThe first row and column test also the same as in the provided example.\nThe order of tests should be different - starting with row-ones, as the second column test actually requires the valid implementation of the row rule\n\nThere are too many things that are not stated in the statement nor given in examples:\n- including how to treat lower case letters (are they in key table or not?)\n- \"letters to their immediate right\" actually can be not immediate right as we go around and modulo.\n\n\nDefinitely it shouldn't be posted as an easy task. (Existence of more difficult easy puzzles is not an argument to make more such misjudged entries.)\nThis puzzle is definitely too long and laborious for this. ENCRYPT would be enough for the puzzle to work - but that's not a critical point just an observation.",
