Some comments:\n\n* Do add [[]] and {{}} formatting to the statement section.\n\n* When introducing \"the first case,\" you should write \"As an example, for test case 1\" or some variation of that.\n\n* The Output description doesn't need to have all the details since those are provided very explicitly in the main statement.\n\n* I don't think you need to mention in the main text that two people can't occupy the same seat, but you should mention that in the constraints.",
