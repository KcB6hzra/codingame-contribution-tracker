    "content": "Nice clash.\n\nValidator 3 gives a very annoying issue in Ruby, and maybe some other languages. Ruby finds that the net moment is -2.842170943040401e-14 due to float arithmetic errors. :(\nI got 80% in my clash because none of the test cases had such an issue... Not sure the best way to fix this, since it's hard to know what tests will give float arithmetic issues in which languages, but it would be nice if there was a test that threw such an error rather than just a validator, so clashers could debug this in-clash. (My code shared in comment below).\n\nAnother smaller issue is that you ask us to display the answer with units \"N\" but moment has units \"Nm\".",
