    "content": "I would like to address two things:\n\n1. It is good to mention that a, b, c, d are integers, but it is better to write the possible range of a, b, c, d (such as, 0 ≤ b < a ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ c ≤ 100, 0 ≤ d ≤ 10000).\n\n2. In the current testcase, I expect that we can get 100% without handling the condition that Tom gains extra money and output is 0 - because there's no such case in Validators. I think that you should add such cases.",
