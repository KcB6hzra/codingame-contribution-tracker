    "content": "Although this problem would make an easy community puzzle, I see two main reasons to switch to this mode:\n\n1. The only reliable way to solve this puzzle in limited time is to fetch the formulas on some random website. I can rediscover these formulas and code them within 5 minutes, but I doubt this will make it in Fastest mode.\n\n2. A solution for this problem may come in handy in order to code a bot for some multiplayer games. So it would be nice to have time to polish the solution and the ability to save it (without having to rely on some external tool).\n\n\nMoreover, I think that Reverse mode is almost impossible if one has never seen the problem before. Shortest mode is the only relevant mode if this problem is to become a CoC.",
