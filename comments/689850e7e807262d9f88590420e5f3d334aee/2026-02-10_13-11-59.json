    "content": "This is a nice clash, but it's a bit of a pain in Shortest mode because you have really inconsistent usage of newlines in your input and output.\n\nYou end up with errors like this in Shortest mode if you don't remove newlines from your output (in Ruby where this is manual):\n\"Found: (3) gEnd of line (\\n)\nExpected: Nothing\"\n\nTests with input having a single extra newline (not a big deal):\nT1, V2\n\nTests with input having TWO extra newlines (a big deal, causing errors):\nV1, T2\n\nTests with output having a single extra newline (not a big deal)\nV3, T5\n\nI could edit it myself, but I thought it would be good to flag it with you instead so you'd know it was an issue. I could've saved 6 characters in Shortest mode if it weren't for V1 and T2, :P.",
