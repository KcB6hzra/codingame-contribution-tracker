    "content": "As mentioned by pioupiou26, please correct the typo to \"specific\".\n\nAlso, in the \"10 cats long duration\" validator, there is one cat Snowflake whose year of death (variable d) is the same as the year being asked about (variable M). Similar case for Maple in the \"10 cats short duration\" test. I assume that cat was at least living for part of that year?\n\n(In contrast, the year of *birth* of Badger in the latter test is the same as the year being asked about.)\n\nI think it is better to clarify in Goal section whether to count a cat when M is equal to the year of birth or the year of death.\n\nThere are duplicated names in one case (Truffle in \"10 cats long duration\" test). Not sure if any player will use those names in their code, but maybe it's better not to have duplicated names, or at least mention such a possibility in Goal section as a warning?\n\nThen in the \"100 cats 100 years\" test, the cat Petunia has b = d, which is in violation of the constraint which says b < d. Please fix it.\n\nAnd finally in the \"100 cats 100 years\" validator, the cat Jameson has d = 101, which is in violation of the constraint which says d < 100. Please fix that case too.\n\nThanks.",
