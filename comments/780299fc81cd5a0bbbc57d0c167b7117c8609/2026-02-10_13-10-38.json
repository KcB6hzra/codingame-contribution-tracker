    "content": "I like the idea - but when solving it I realized that it came down to copying the spelled numbers, putting square brackets around it, using the digit as list-index, and then replace old for new (Python). Felt like a shame to only spend 20 seconds on such a nice clash idea.\n\nI do agree that you put the spelled-out numbers in the statement (no need to turn this clash into a typing match). However, I expected to encounter multiple old/new in the later cases, which would have forced me to at least loop over the old and new. Possibly even a new one reused as old (for example v f but also f v), so that you have to be careful with replacing (i.e. five should become vife but if you are not careful you turn it into fife and then vive).\nBut hey, that's just my opinion :man_shrugging:.",

Please revise the \"But here we did\" validator to be similar to \"No mistake\" test (i.e. old letter not in the correct spelling).\n\nStub generator\n* Please use the same variable name as in other sections (D => digit).\n\nThanks.",
