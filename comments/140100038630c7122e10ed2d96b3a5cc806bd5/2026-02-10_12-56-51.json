    "content": "❌ Rejected the contribution.\nComment: After reviewing the approved clash as pointed out by @kozuechan, I am of the opinion that this clash is too similar in nature, even though the vowel set is one letter (\"Y\") different. At the core, both clashes require the same operations performed in the same order.\n\nIf both clashes were currently pending approval (i.e., assuming the approved clash were not already approved), I would still pick the other clash due to the added complexity of handling the empty output. I understand that this makes clashes less fun to some, but I believe it's an edge case worth being thrown into the mix for the player's consideration.",
