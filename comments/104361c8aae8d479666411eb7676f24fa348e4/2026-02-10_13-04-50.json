    "content": "Hello creating this coding battle I wanted to pass as an input an integer (in base 10) and a base (from 2 to 10). The objective was to output the result but expressed in the given base (for exemple in binary : 110 would give 10101 because there is one \"1\" and two (\"10\" in binary) \"1\". \nHowever I thought it wouldn't fit anymore in a coding battle. What do you guys think ?",

Maybe for a normal one, where people wouldn't have to guess?\nBecause it would be - I think -, too difficult to guess that it refers to counting the digits if different bases are involved?\n\nOtherwise, the Clash as it is right now works nicely",
