    "content": "This is a fun clash of code! \nI think \"The goal is to get the character in string at the index of toGet. The chars variable has a set of characters that each character represents an index of the string that you will get with the toGet variable.\" should be reworded. Perhaps along the lines of \"The chars variable has a set of characters. The string variable is a given phrase. The toGet variable has a given character(s). The goal is to output the character in string found at the same index of toGet in chars.\"  \n\nI do not think my rewording is the best either; but it just seems like something could be done to make it a bit easier to understand before even seeing the example. \n\nQuestion:\nShould the variable name string be changed or shortened for easier and for avoiding the use of the word string by any coding languages?\n\nHope everything with this goes well !",
