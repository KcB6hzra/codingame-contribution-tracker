In order to solve this clash, we must do all these steps in a short time:\n\n- understand that the output is not a flow rate, but a ratio of a flow rate to the maximum flow rate\n- guess that the total temperature is the weighted average of the two temperatures\n- guess that the total flow is the sum of the two flows\n- correctly express the problem as a linear system of 2 equations in 2 unknowns\n- solve the linear system of equations\n- understand that the \"maximum flow rate\" of a tap is not a constraint to be added to the equations (in fact, it is, but the tests and validators have been chosen so that this constraint can be ignored)\n- need to understand how precisely to display the floating-point output (this is always harder than you think, especially on a speed contest like Clash of code!!)",

I think it would be extremely hard for people who don't have one.\n\nSome clashers may not even know the basic facts needed to solve this like that mixing two flows of water at different temperatures, the resultant water will have a flow equal to the sum of the two and a temperature equal to the weighted average (weighted by flows).\n\nI'm not sure if this is a good clash, because the only way to make it fair is to give so many hints and explanations that it no longer works well as a problem...\n\nIt seems to me that this is more of a physics/algebra problem than a coding problem...",
