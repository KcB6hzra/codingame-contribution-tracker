I saw 1 year ago the creator was asked to edit it and never has. I just got 85% on a clash because of this bug.\n\nAlso, I made a small edit where the statement said:\n\"Input always starts and ends with plains (-)\"\nand corrected it to:\n\"Input always starts and ends with plains (_)\"",

    "content": "I'm sorry but the statement makes no sense.\nHow is the player supposed to guess that \"||\" is a \"mountain\"?\nExcept for reverse, the player should not have to inspect the output to understand what you mean by \"mountain\".\nWhen I see \"mountain\" I expect things like /\\ or /--\\ but not \"||'.\nWhat's more the statement is plainly wrong, you claim \"_/-\\|\" are the only valid characters and yet out of the blue the \"=\" characters appears in a validator, making it impossible for the player to get 100% without prior knowledge.\nShame on the moderators for accepting a problem that is clearly not ready.",
