However this one requires some further algorithmic work (maybe not enough though) and can be a nice starting point to learn new stuff (you often have to resort to the internet for that). You've validated such problems in the past https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/cheat-solving\n\nAs for ECC and Discrete Log (as I've validated both), there were long discussions on these problems that were both validated after a long pending period. I admit I mostly focused on the issues with the content and have neglected some format problems with ECC. On the one hand, 4 people have approved/rejected (sometimes both successively!) ECC, among which I was the only one to have actually said something in the comments (hence, despite being long enough, the reviewing process was not optimal for sure). On the other hand, sqrt-decomposition and meet-in-the-middle are classical problem solving techniques and the intended approach for Discrete Log (Baby-step Giant-step) is a reasonable application of these techniques (for a \"hard\" problem).\n\nAnd finally, about all these \"rules\" on \"no 64-bit\" (in 2019 FFS!), \"self-contained\", \"not pe-like\", etc. Could somebody who knows them write them somewhere and ask for CG to include them in the doc?",
