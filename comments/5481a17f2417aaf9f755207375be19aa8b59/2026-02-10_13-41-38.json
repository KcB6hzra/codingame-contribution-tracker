    "content": "My puzzle solution\n\nSPOILER BELOW!\n\nA cube configuration is made up of 54 stickers. Each twist of the Rubik's cube corresponds to applying a permutation to these stickers.\n\nThe tasks asks us to find the doubly solved configuration. If we find a permutation Given -> Solved, then applying it again we get Solved -> Answer. If the sticker colors were unique, finding the permutation would be trivial, but they are not.\n\nThe Rubik's cube is built of 3x3x3 smaller cubes called \"cubies\". Since they are solid, the set of stickers belonging to a each cubie never changes, and can hence be used to identify the cubie. It turns out each sticker can be uniquely identified by its color and cubie.\n\nPutting this together:\n1.\nFor each of the 54 stickers, assign it to a cubie by 3d coordinate. This can be done by 6 cases in a double for loop. Each cubie then has a set of colors identifying it.\n2.\nFor each sticker, add the set of colors from its assigned cubie as its disambiguating context.\n3.\nCompute the above procedure for the given configuration and the solved configuration.\n4.\nLet's name the configurations Given, Solved and Answer, and use Given[A] for the color and context of the sticker at position A of Given. If Given[A] corresponds to Solved[B], then Solved[A] will correspond to Answer[B].",
