    "content": "I'm really surprised there is so much controversy over a temperature conversion question. I thought temperature conversion was something that people learned early on, but maybe we only do it in the US because we like Fahrenheit so much. Either way, in over 300 challenges I've never come into contact with a temperature conversion challenge so I thought this would be a fun and original challenge that I have yet to see and it would take less than 5 minutes to complete. Honestly, after the time I've spent on this contribution and the responses I've gotten I'm almost done with contributing at all. I thought Clash contributions should be short problems with clear explanations that could be solved in under 5 minutes. I didn't realize there was so much subjectivity in the originality of a problem. After the amount of duplicated, unoriginal, and down right simple (like multiply two numbers together, simple) clashes that I've faced, I'm surprised to get this kind of response to a problem that is not just a simple multiply or convert to binary problem like so many out there. \"Not an original idea, Sorry!\" Is not the way you grow contributors in your community.",

A lot of moderators still expect Clash of Code to be original even if it doesn't have to be. I think also that some of them find simple exercises not original because they don't have fun solving them and expect to encounter more challenging exercises. This is not an excuse but an explanation.\nWe have thought of adding a difficulty tag in the puzzle, and also perhaps leagues but nothing is planned yet.\nThank you for contributing to CodinGame",
