After reading the description i would have expected that an higher altitude at the simulations end would result in a higher second number in the result.\n\nFor example i would have expected the following position to be \"2 2\" not \"2 0\"\n\n..V..\n.....\n.....\n\nThis is especially problematic since it is impossible to see in the given example.\n\n\nAside from that it is mildly irritating that width and height are constant but the example uses another height and width. I would change the example or (and this is what i would prefer) make height and width input parameters .\n\nBeside from that i would would like to see the challenge being approved/upvoted.",

It doesn't change at all for the puzzle, but it make the subject more... coherent.\n\n\"Here we consider our paraglider vertical speed is 1m/s and horizontal speed is 10m/s\"\nIt means each turn, the glider go right by one step and down by one step (in case there is no thermal activity value on the cell)\n[ ! ] I should maybe say in the description that it goes from left to right, I add it !\n\nActually in the example I don't show the step between because it's counted as one turn, but to explain in one turn, the paraglider goes down right, and if it encounter a thermal activity it modify vertical position : y += grid[posy][posx]",
