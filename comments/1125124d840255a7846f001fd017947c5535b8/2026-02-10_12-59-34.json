I managed to pass all testcases except last 3, I think it might be a precision issue in my code, I'll take a deeper look into it.\n\nI noticed you wrote \"Any angles should be truncated to 2 decimal places\". A more efficient way to check if a bridge is walkable, in this case (45°) is to check wether its horizontal distance is longer than its vertical distance, i.e sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2) >= abs(z1-z2).\nUnfortunately, there is (at least) one testcase where this method doesn't work : validator Angle Checker. The angle between the Hometree and the first island is just over 45° (705.69m horizontally and 705.80m vertically), but using angle approximations to 2 decimal places, it is right on the limit (pi/4). I suggest to update the statement and testcases using this method (or to change the precision).\nThanks !",

It presents an interesting challenge by combining elements of 3D geometry, resource optimization, and network management. The game involves connecting floating islands while minimizing the amount of wood used, while respecting constraints like distance and bridge angles, making it a stimulating and rewarding problem. Additionally, the management of leftover wood and the requirement to connect at least one island to the Hometree adds an intriguing strategic layer. This game is an excellent opportunity for participants to test their skills in algorithm design and optimization while solving a complex and original problem.",
