    "content": "Not sure if I understand it how this can go wrong even though I can imagine it being confusing. The way I interpret your comment is that you imagine this world similar to the Cartesian coordinate system where height is represented on the y-axis (same as I do). In this case it is ambiguous whether the tree is on the left corner of the interval or the right. But regardless where you put it, if you put the consistently to the left or to the right, the same result should yield to all cases.\n\nCan you please further elaborate on what I'm missing?",

    "content": "Haha, this is much simpler than this :) I was just imagining the tree to fall a bit off its actual position, like a real tree actually. With this, a \"0 2\" tree, for instance, would fall and occupy position 1 and position 2. Obviously this is not the case in your puzzle: fallen tree occupies positions 0 and 1. If you follow the wrong rule, only the last test will fail (all other pass).",
