    "content": "Nice clash, but it's a bit misleading in the wording.\n\nYou emphasise \"check if the vending machine can be properly FILLED\". Really, the clash is about emptying the new items into the machine. The machine is rarely FILLED after any of these tests.\n\nA full machine for the first test case, for example, would need 50 items in total (5 compartments and 10 slots each), but there are only 16 items available.\n\nThis confused me for a while in my clash before I realised you really were saying \"check if the vending machine can fit all these items properly\".\n\nI won the clash with 100%, two others had 11% and the rest had 0%. I am not sure if the wording is what confused the others, but I'm sure it would help if you made it a bit more clear.",

    "content": "Once I fully understood the protocol, it was a pleasant puzzle to solve. I only have 2 suggestions.\n\n1. Maybe edit the protocol description a bit, so that it takes less time to grasp the input format at first glance?\n\nFor example:\nLine 1: number C of compartments in the machine\nLine 2: number S of slots in a compartment\nLine 3: number N of item types\nLine 4: list of N integers separated by space, representing number of items of each type\n\n2. The constraints section seems a bit distracting to me. What is the point of using such a high upper bound (2^30)? Since N can be 2^30 - 1, and there will be N integers on line 4, player can be confused by a thought that they have to deal with an enormous string / input array which can consume a huge amount of RAM or something like that. How about using some relatively small number for the upper bound and also making the inequality inclusive to make it easier to parse it at first glance?\n\nFor example:\n1 <= C, S, N, M <= 1000",

    "content": "A good puzzle!\n\nSome suggestions:\n\n(1) include a \"print\" line in the stub\n\n(2) Validators should test the same thing as their corresponding test. For instance, you might have a test and a validator where all Ms are exact multiples of S.\n\n(3) A player could write \"print(\"no\")\" and pass 75% of your validators without ever attempting to solve the puzzle. Consider making the outputs more complex, e.g. \"no, short by 3 compartments\"",
