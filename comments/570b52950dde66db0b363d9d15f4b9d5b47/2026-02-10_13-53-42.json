Two subsequent cards in same orientation are apart by half an arch-width, so one of them necessarily can't have support.\n\nMaking that case stable would need (for example) declaring them to be touching by an entire plane, which in turns needs to either have them almost an entire half-arch *thick*, or to declare the input diagram non-constant-width.\nNeither of which fits the visuals.",
