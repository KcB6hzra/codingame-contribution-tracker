    "content": "I really wish that the data had been supplied AFTER the code\n\nI've written a compiler in C that cross-compiles the MCxxx code into native x86 code, marks the section as executable and then calls it.  Thus executing the MCxxxx program on the ia64 CPU directly.\n\nBut... there's a slight problem with the contribution.  The unusual order of the inputs.  Data first, then code?\n\nBy the time we receive the code, the data has already been removed from the stdin.  So, I can't create solutions that read from stdin... it has to read from a buffered version, which kind of sucks.\n\nThe error requirements also require buffering the output too.\n\nI imagine that most people attempting this type of challenge would want the data to be provided AFTER the code, so that their solution can process directly from the input stream.\n\nJust a minor grumble, admittedly.  But it would make sense to provide inputs in the order they are most likely to be used.\n\nBut, hey, it's here now - and it IS a good challenge : )))\n\nWell done Exanc!  10/10",

I have some comments on the description  :\n- After the sentence \"Please note that some instructions of this language will not be included ...\" you should add something like \"all instructions below are necessary for this puzzle\" because I was not sure.\n- in the \"mul\" instruction it is not clear that the result is stored in acc\n- for the \"dgt\" instruction you should use the same syntax as for \"dst\" so : \"Isolate the digt of acc specified by the first operand\"\n- for \"dgt\" and \"dst\" you could precise \"decimal\" digit\n- I would move the \"captions\" section before the instructions \n- I deduced it, but it is not clear that the \"-\" instructions are enabled when the tests are false\n- It could be added that the tests applies to all the next \"+/-\" instructions and not only the next one.\n- The variables in the \"input\" section (l, InputData, N and LineOfCode) should be the same as in the stub generator (d,x0,n,INSTRUCTION)\n- In the first test case which appears as an example, I would choose a number different than 1 for the input so there it is easier to understand what is going on.\n\nNothing there is major, just some fine tuning. I will let you polish this before I approve. Nice job\nAdam",

Also you could add \"respectively\" at the end of the sentence.\nAnd I still think that the sentence explaining the dgt instruction is not clear, but maybe it's me.\nApproved !\nAdam",
