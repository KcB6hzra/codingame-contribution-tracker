    "content": "Good edits.\n\nThere still \"Stack\" in the description and the name tho.\n\nAlso, the usage of the \"palindrome\" word here is confusing since no word is a palindrome of another word. Closing parenthesis here is just opening ones but reversed.\n\nI suggest changing Statement to: `\nCheck for Balanced Brackets/parenthesis in an expression (well-formedness).\n\nIn this problem, a word beginning with _ (underscore) is \"brackets open.\" Same word but reversed and with an underscore at the and is \"brackets close\".\nUnderscore will not be used anywhere else.\n\nExample: _brackets x + 1 stekcarb_ * y + _parenthesis 7 * 5 sisehtnerap_\nBrackets here are balanced.\n\nThe math should not be checked, only if the delimiters are balanced.\n`\nAnd removing \"with stack\" from the name. And also removing \"palindrome\" from one of the tests.\n\nAnd I need to make it clear that while \"do not say players how to solve\" is more of my personal liking, usage of \"palindrome\" instead of \"reverse\" makes the statement unclear and therefore not viable enough (in my opinion).",
