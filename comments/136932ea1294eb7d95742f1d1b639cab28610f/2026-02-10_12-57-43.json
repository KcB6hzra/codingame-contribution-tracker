(Your original intention might be for the player to figure out the shortcut method, as shown in your solution, but…) This approach would simplify both the explanation and the illustrative example. For instance, players could be asked to sort the numbers by the 1st digit only, or by the 4th digit only, without introducing the concept of buckets.\n\nRegardless of the above suggestion, the statement should specify what to do when a number doesn't have a digit in that position (e.g. treat the missing digit as 0).\n\nIf you intend to retain the original multi-iteration task, the statement should explicitly clarify that the sorted sequence of each iteration serves as the input for the next iteration. Also, the phrase \"concatenating the buckets\" may sound a bit abstract for some readers. You might consider using simpler and clearer wording.\n\nUsing point form to list the steps could also help.\n\nThanks.",
