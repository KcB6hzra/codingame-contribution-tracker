    "content": "This problem was really enjoyable for me! I liked how it required both logical thinking and creativity to visualize the bookshelf. The combination of handling input and designing the structure using | and - to represent books made the task feel engaging. It was a nice balance between simplicity and challenge, and I had fun figuring out how to properly format the output. The constraints were just right, making it a rewarding experience without being too overwhelming.",

    "content": "This is a wonderful problem and I enjoyed solving it, but I feel like it may be a little too hard for a Clash of Code. I wasn't able to solve it in less than 10 minutes although it would have gone faster in Python. I think it would be perfect difficulty for a Clash (on the hard side) if all the books were the same width. It's also great as-is for an easy puzzle. Just my 2c, as someone who has been playing Clashes for a few months, I could be wrong.",
