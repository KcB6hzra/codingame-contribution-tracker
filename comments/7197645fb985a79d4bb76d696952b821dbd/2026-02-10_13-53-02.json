    "content": "There is a problem with Validator 8 and 10.\nIt seems that they may fail while all IDE tests are OK, when two buildings are next one to the other (x_2 of first building  equals x_1 of second building, with different heights). The case is not covered in IDE.\n\nI had to find and use this contribution page to solve it thanks to validators access.\nMaybe inverting IDE & Validation 8 (or 10) would make it possible to understand the problem in this case",
