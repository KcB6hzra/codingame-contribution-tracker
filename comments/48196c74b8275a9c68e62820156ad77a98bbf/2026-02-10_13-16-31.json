Once I had your puzzle finished, the other puzzle took me less than 2 minutes.\n\nI have to admit that I rarely look at my output. I simply look to see if the test case turns green and I look at any debug output I'm generating. Probably not the best technique on my part, but it made these two puzzles feel almost identical.\n\nNow that I've gone back and looked at the output, it is kind of cool to see the grids with just the found words. All Codingamers are different and this might not be unique enough to some. In this case, the opinion that I think matters the most is that of @nicola.",
