Also, if size = n = 1 is allowed, then an appropriate test case would be needed to check if player is handling this edge case properly. (In this case the validator can be only the same.)\nAnother small thing: \"2n-1 lines of digits 1-n\" should be \"2n-1 lines of digits 1..n\" as the - sign is used twice with different meaning in the same sentence which is not nice, even if understandable.\nMedium difficulty is good IMHO and I found your description clear.\nBacktracking tag is is good, I have no other recommendation.",
