    "content": "I like the concept of this puzzle. Simple rules, yet will make you think how to implement it in code. One thing I would suggest is to expand the given example in the problem statement, specifically to add a line for the given input to better visualize the 'rearrange from horizontal to vertical'.\n\nSome of the comments below are also worth noting, particularly the end case of having a result with digits greater than the max width of operands plus 2. ex 999*999 = 998,001 (6digits)",

    "content": "Nice idea, but needs a minor rework to make it more realistic for CoC.\n1. Avoid usage of many lines in input - the equation could have more operands, but all in one line. Example: 15 + 12 - 22 + 101\n2. Avoid usage of multiplication and division. Yes, I know it is simple to do calculations in proper order using stack, but it is obviously not a topic for CoC.\n3. As result of previous two suggestions - the output should be not always 3 lines, but count of operations in input + 2(including the result). Output for example 1:\n      15\n+    12\n-     22\n+  101\n- - - - -\n    106\n\nPlease upvote if you agree with these ideas.",

    "content": "I think this puzzle is just a bit too complicated for clash of code. I came up with my first solution in about 9 minutes and it wasn't even correct because of the left just and right just rule for the operator and second value in each equation. \n\nEven the example part was confusing because it was not intuitive to me. I figured that the width should be determined by the max width of [operand1,operand2 + 2(operator plus space),resultant]. If you have multiplication you could easily have an issue with the syntax you've created. For example 999 * 999 yields a 6-digit value,which wouldn't fit in the 5 character wide equation.",
