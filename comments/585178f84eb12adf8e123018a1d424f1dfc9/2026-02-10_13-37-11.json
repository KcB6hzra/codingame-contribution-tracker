Perhaps consider renaming \"Attack\" to \"Assassinate\"",

Some suggestions to clarify the rules:\n\nUnder BLOCK, add a note on income:\nEach turn, the player receives income from the number of blocks they control.\n\nSuppose in this picture the soldier is facing UP, then it can move to the GREEN coloured tiles and can't move to the RED coloured tile. \nSo basically the soldier just can't move in the opposite direction of where it is facing.\n\nSuppose in this picture the soldier is facing UP, then the GREEN coloured tiles are soldier attacking sites.\n\nATTACK\n... and the level of the opponent's soldier should be less than or equal to your soldier's level. It costs you 35 Bucks to attack. The command for the action looks like - 'ATTACK ID OPPONENT_SOLDIER_ID' in which ID is the unique identifier of your soldier, and OPPONENT_SOLDIER_ID is the id of the opponent soldier that you want to attack.\n\nMinor typos:\nLose Conditions: victoy -> victory\nrefree code -> referee code\nInput per turn: Fix the &nbsp;\nreprenseted -> represented\nYour code should respond in under 100 ms.",
