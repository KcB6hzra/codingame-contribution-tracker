I think it was because of this sentence:\n\"Your customers have lined up, so that every other customer orders tea starting with the second one (so every second customer orders tea (2, 4, 6, 8, ...). \"\n\nI personally think you could shorten that part to something like this:\n\"Your customers have lined up so that every second customer orders tea (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...)\"\n\nBut that's just my preference. I think it's a great idea for a clash. :D",
