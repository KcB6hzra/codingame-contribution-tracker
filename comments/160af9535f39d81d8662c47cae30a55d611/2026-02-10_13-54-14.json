A harder version of this puzzle could be you're given all the sides and have to figure out what the colors will be given some moves after for all sides.\n\nThat said, I think it would be better if you separated your commands with spaces, replaced the - with the industry standard ', and dropped the dots entirely.  Human readability in this case matters insofar as understanding how to make the code interpret it.  Also, the dots don't actually make it more readable.  New lines would, but they would complicate the code.",

For POV reference, my current worst linecount is haunted manor at 100 (I could probably shave the 20 lines of \"verification\" code now it works), barnyard at 56 (because parsing).\n\nThis one looks like it's going to be 6 lines of state initialization (that's a lot of \\n), 6 times 3 painfully induced orbits, and 2.5 lines of applying the permutations.\n\nNothing convoluted. But no point in automating the permutations' definition on such a small group. Hence the tediousness.\n\n(note that it *is* a lot better than when we initially discussed it, since as a community puzzle I'll only need to solve it once)\n\nSo I'll solve it when (if) it gets approved. I won't enjoy it. I'll probably just copy-paste the perms from an online source.",

(seems to be your example implementing Right in terms of Left) (there are other ways, but come one, srlsy) You can choose whether to implement all six, or only three and symmetry, or only two and rotation (srlsy), or only one and the whole shebang. My point is: the basic case (in my world) is tedious, and any simplification thereupon tends to win so little because 2x2x2 that actually taking the time to decide what the right level of simplification is will likely feel like a net loss in the end.\n\n(I am fully aware of the irony of the fact I've now spent more time raising tediousness alarms than I'd need to solve.
