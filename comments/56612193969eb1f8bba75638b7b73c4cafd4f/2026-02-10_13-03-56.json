    "content": "I've tried to add some visualisation in the banner of the puzzle but unfortunately you can't really do that in the description. If you look at the theory behind, m-trails are simple paths in the topology graphs. Indeed, creating m-trails is a hard task as you need to make sure that the alarm codes (rows of the matrix) are unique for each link, as well as the m-trails are connected paths in the graph (columns of the matrix). For single link failure localization efficient heuristics exist where you start with a unique matrix and swap the codes until the columns form an m-trail. However, for arbitrary multiple failures the problem becomes NP-complete, and we can only solve some specific failure patterns efficiently.",
