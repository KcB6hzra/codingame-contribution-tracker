There's no REAL need of a smaller test case for debug, it can be managed, but having a fixed value set as 1000, yet still putting it as input is strange. In your solution you compute the tolerance. When I've tested, I stored the benford values as 301, 176, 125, ... and tested value +- 100. It was lazy, but worked because N was a constant.\n\nFor the second topic, maybe just mentionning what you just said? That it could be any currencies...",
