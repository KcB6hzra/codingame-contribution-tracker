    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: Outstanding puzzle! Over 8 months of work has gone into this puzzle since the original submission and it shows. The test cases are incredibly thorough. The design of the puzzle requires solutions to have a little bit of optimization, a little bit of combinatorics and a little bit of algorithmic complexity. None of those concepts alone are crazy tough, but the way this puzzle puts them all together creates a really nice hard level, yet doable, puzzle.\n\nOne suggestion - if it were me, I would eliminate rule 4, which doesn't seem critical to me, but definitely provides a solid hint for the optimization part of the puzzle. This is not a deal-breaker for me, just a thought.",

I am curious what the opinion is on difficulty level - keep it at Medium or switch it to Hard? Thanks in advance for your thoughts, CG community!",

It is deceptively challenging in a real world sort of way. All the information I needed to solve it was right in the problem statement, but I kept drifting off track into my own thoughts of how \"things should be\".\n\nI also struggled to build a good abstract model of the problem in my code, again because, in my mind, I understood the requirements better than the author. (I hear this is sometimes still an issue for software developers.)\n\nVery nice puzzle. I would not mind if this puzzle requires another 30 days for full approval. I ran across some nice edge case testing in the end that I'd be glad to explore a bit further.",

I think my error was in identifying which apple to leave out of the applied advertisement.\n\nI'll send you a PM with my earlier code that can pass all test cases, but fails validator 10.",

Is that the intended approach? The current wording gives me an impression that I don't have to consider applying B then A.\n\n* \"-- If of X items, Y need to be paid, and X>Y, the highest prices are waived. (If, by some mistake, X<Y, the lowest prices are added)\"\nErm... initially I thought the case of X<Y should be removed because it didn't make sense. And then I think, hey we're just the IT guys, we don't make the business decisions for management, so...\nSuggest to change \"by some mistake\" to \"to discourage customers from bulk purchasing limited-stock items\", and remove the brackets. Also suggest to add an example e.g. \"All vegetables: 3 for the price of 5\" here, because initially I had no idea what this point referred to.\n\nThanks.",

I started with 'Easy', which I think is the case with all situations in which there are not multiple advertisements applicable for one item. However, I struggled myself with the solution for the cases in which there are multiple advertisements applicable for the same items (cases 7 and 10), and have for that reason now set it at 'Medium'.",

    "content": "Cool! I've updated the puzzle according to most of your suggestions. Some remarks:\n- I do not see the need for specifying rounding. There will never be any multiplication or division, only the removal(or addition) of prices. So, for example, out of 3.00, 2.00, 4.50, 2.00 and 2.50, the 4.50 is waived due to 2 for 1 on deodorant. So, result is some combination of adding all prices and subtracting the discount -- and finally giving that as output with two decimal places; rounding is never an issue in my opinion.\n- I have tried to clarify the last point by specifying that the other order is also possible, and that the order, which leads to the best result for the customer, needs to be used. Indeed, like you state it (first calculate A-B then B-A and compare) is the intended approach. Mainly, with this point I want to avoid the complexity of 'a bit of A and a bit of B'; that would lead to much more possible discount variations (and I did not know how to program the solution for that :-)).\n- The X<Y case I particularly like. I want to leave it in the middle whether it is to discourage customers, or to trick customers, or whether it is a genuine mistake. I like the point where an IT guy can simply deliver what is requested, but that possibly the request is stupid. I did kind of want to keep it a secret (small twist to run into when working on cases 8 and 9), but I do on the other hand agree that text in a statement should be clear --> for the X<Y I have added an example in the statement).",

Amazingly, this updated solution lead to no difference for all other tests&validators, so you managed to find an additional relevant case, which I added. At the moment I am not sharp enough to realize exactly what is different about this one.\n\n(The mistake in my code was that I only marked X items as used, while that should be X * the times the advertisement could be applied. I guess there was not yet a test/validator situation in which there were items qualifying for multiple advertisements AND one of those adds could be applied multiple times AND that still would be the worse option - hm maybe I do realize what the difference is after all)\n\nOne question: you nicely test your own scenarios - do you do that simply by temporarily adding a test/validator pair, or is there some smarter way to test other scenarios?",

You are clearly not one of them :-). \n\nSomething that happened in real life to me: Parking 6EUR per hour, >6 hours for 25EUR. I was parked there for 5 hours, and had to pay 30EUR.

So, three times a pair needs to be made of which the lowest price is added. The case best for the customer is pairs of 5/30, 5/30 and 10/10. For the 5/30 pair, 5 is added 4 times, to get 2 for the price of 6 (items 5 and 30 for the price of 5,5,5,5,5,30). In other words, total price becomes (5*5+30)+(5*5+30)+(10*5+10) = 170.

    "content": "First of all, I love the complexity of how the products and the advertisements interact on this puzzle. However, I do believe we have to do everything possible to avoid situations where test cases can be passed while validators still fail. I'm not sure this is a perfect solution, but here are my thoughts.\n\n@Rafarafa has some code that does the following:\n\nPass \"8 Good for business 1\"\nFail \"Good for business 1: validator\"\n\nPass: \"12 Mixed advertisements 2\"\nFail: \"Mixed advertisements 2: validator\"\n\nI think the puzzle might benefit from swapping the test case and the validator in both of these situations. For each, I think the validator has slightly more complexity than the test case and that leaves the door open for passing the test case while failing the validator.\n\nRe: Good for Business\n\nThe test case is 2 for the price of 4 with 8 qualifying products. Even the eight qualifying products can be broken into two groups of 4 by brand/price.  Nice symmetry. Everything is a power of 2. I feel like this symmetry allowed the bug to slide through.\n\nThe validator is 3 for the price of 5 with 9 qualifying products which can be broken into a group of 4 and a group of 5 based on brand/price. I wish I knew how to articulate it better, but I believe this less symmetrical product layout catches bugs not caught in the test case.\n\nRe: Mixed Advertisements 2\n\nLet's look at the 4 advertisements for the test case:\n4 snacks for the price of 3 --> 5 products qualify\n3 nuts for the price of 2 --> 3 products qualify\n2 icecream for the price of 1 -->  2 products qualify\n10 desserts for the price of 6 --> 10 products qualify\n\nIn 3 of the 4 advertisements, the number of qualifying products is conveniently exactly what the advertisement calls for. Only one advertisement will leave some product unaccounted for after the advertisement is applied.\n\nCompare that to the validator:\n4 nuut for the price of 3 --> 4 products qualify\n3 cheeseplatter for the price of 1 --> 4 products qualify\n3 snacks for the price of 2 --> 5 products qualify\n10 desserts for the price of 6 -->  13 products qualify\n\nIn 3 of the 4 validator advertisements, leftover product must be accounted for after the advertisement is applied. I believe this added complexity might be what catches bugs the test case did not.\n\nThat's the best I can come up with. I hope it helps!",
