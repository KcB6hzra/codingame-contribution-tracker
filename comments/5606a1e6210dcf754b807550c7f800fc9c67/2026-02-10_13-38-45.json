    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: One of my favourite problems in my early years of learning coding.\n\nIf I might add a couple of things:\n* Goal statement, example part: V1 should be simply V, as V1 = 1 and V2 = 5. Also, even though 1 and 5 are not constants per se, the blue notation would make it super clear what's happenning. So it would be something like [[V]] = { {{1}}, {{5}} } and then the real nice part is \"up to 10: {{1}} * 10, {{5}} * 2 and {{1}} * 5 + {{5}} * 1\". This leads the eye to distinguish between the numbers as multiplcation is commutative but these values are not interchangable and there is a logical jump between talking about addition only and using mutiplication in your example.\n* Take it or leave it: I loved how you named your variables based on what they denote. With that said I suggest renaming N to A (amount). If you take this suggestion don't forget to update the stub, too.\n* Constraints: the last example uses N = 2000, so either decrease that or increase the constraint value. I'm a little more on the side of decreasing for the sake of slower languages but it's up to you.\n* Lastly, based on your implementation the Validator where the only coin you have is 0, you can easily run into an infinite loop. Since there is no check for that in the test cases that would result in a lot of confusion. While I do realise the example coins in this exercise don't have to be real looking, having a coing with value 0, is not something that my brain can comprehend. :) If you modify that validator to not be 0, please update the constraints. If not, please set the corresponging test case to have the same corner case checked.",
