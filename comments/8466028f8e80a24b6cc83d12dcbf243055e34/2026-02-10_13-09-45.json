    "content": "I fail to see what's interesting about this badly formulated problem.\n\n> Output a single integer representing the squared sum of the minutes taken to reach A, B, and C. If the result is a decimal value, it should be rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\nThe \"result\" referred to in the last sentence is the squared sum of the minutes. For the input of \"80\\n10 30 20\" this means taking the sum of 7.5 + 22.5 + 15, squaring and flooring it, which results in 2025. Nowhere does the statement mention that you're also supposed to round down the minutes in each individual segment (so that it becomes 7 + 22 + 15). Note that for the input of \"61\\n1 1 1\" the expected result is 0 because I guess it takes zero minutes to travel one kilometer three times.\n\nI played this in fastest, but ended up playing as if it's the reverse mode (which is disabled here, ironically). How this was approved is beyond me.",
