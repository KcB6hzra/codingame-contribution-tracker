    "content": "10x10 (and any other even-sized board) is a trivial draw. If you mirror your opponent's moves, the grid fills symmetrically and the score is equal. Switching back to 9x9 should fix this. 9x9 had a strong bias for player 1 because they get an extra turn, but now there's a second round to balance the player 1 advantage which was added after the switch to 10x10. Since the winner is whoever gets the most points in both rounds combined, the game is balanced.",

    "content": "There is one very important thing missing from the statement. You should explain that, during a game, each player plays two matches with reversed colors in order to avoid the first player advantage and keep the game balanced. The final score is the sum of the points scored by each player during the two matches. \n\nTherefore, a bot should be able to restart with a fresh state. For instance, if the number of available moves is 100 (resp. 99), you have a new game and you are the first (resp. second) player. I found this was the easiest way for a proper restart detection.",
