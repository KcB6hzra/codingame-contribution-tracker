For instance, if two players put a card on the same line and the last completes the line to 6, the other players cannot know which card has been played in 5th position. This hidden information is not symmetric and is not part of the original game. Therefore, I believe penalty cards should be part of the inputs.\nRegarding my previous remark on being unable to place a card, I think it would be better if the referee allow for choice on the line to pick.",
