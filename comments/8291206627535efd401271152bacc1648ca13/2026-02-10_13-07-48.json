Further, I'd personally say that a rather difficult puzzle in CoC wouldn't be too bad as there are way too many 30-second-puzzles for my feeling. However, I  completely understand if you don't agree and if this gets rejected, I'll republish it as puzzle with the addition of \"walls\", as I think the current version is a bit too easy for a puzzle.",
