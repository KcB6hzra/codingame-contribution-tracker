    "content": "This is pretty hard. Definitely too hard for Reverse mode in my opinion.\nI tried for 6 minutes to solve it under Reverse conditions and just became annoyed.\n\nAfter reading the description, I am confident this should be disabled for Reverse. It's simply too hard to see what you're asking clashers to do from the test input/outputs alone. The fact that you use spaces as the \"blank\" for the triangle makes it impossible to see the triangle shape. Whereas if you'd used \"*\" as the blank character it might have been solvable in Reverse, e.g.: \"I am Groot\" becomes:\nI\nam\n***\n****\nGroot\n\nWith spaces being used, and then stripped away, there is no triangle to be seen in the test cases, and no way to reliably reverse-engineer the solution.\n\nHowever, the clash is good for Fastest and Shortest modes. I solved it in about 5 minutes and would approve if you disable Reverse.",
