    "content": "✅ Approved the contribution.\nComment: Cute and fun puzzle. \nThe statement is short and clear and the puzzle it's easy enough to be done in the available time, so it's perfect for a clash.\nMaybe in some languages if there isn't a translate function/method avaliable can be a little harder, but since the amount of symbols to change is small I think even in that case can be done in 15 min.\nThe test/validators seems good to me too.\nMaybe you can add a small note that the remaining spaces on the right should be preserved when you print the answer, but I think it's not really necessary.",
