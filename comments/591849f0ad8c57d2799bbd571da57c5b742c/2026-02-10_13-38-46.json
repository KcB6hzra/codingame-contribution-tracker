    "content": "Nice simple clash, but \"Can you handle it?\" and \"Validator 6\" are both against the spirit of the statement by adding the unnecessary leading zeroes to the inputs. You don't mention this anywhere in the statement and specify that the inputs will be space-separated *integers*, so it seems like the leading zeroes shouldn't be there.\n\nIt also makes Shortest mode a bit annoying because you can't do certain tricks involving \"eval\" anymore because eval treats a leading \"0\" as an indicator that the string should be interpreted as 'octal' in Ruby.\n\nI think this clash would be better if you removed the leading zeroes.",
