    "content": "I guess if you want to have this puzzle as a community puzzle, you should have harder function not just polynomial ones. If it's for clashes as it is said, restrict to polynom and change your example.\nThe function provided as an example is hard to understand.\n\nMaybe something like :\nGiven a polynom F, output, the derivative of this polynom.\nLet's say you have the function f(x)=c*x^(n)\n\nIt's derivative would be c*n*x^(n-1)\nFor example: 5x^6 would become 30x^5\n\nBut in fact, even though it seems to be a mathematical exercice, it's all about string parse and that's it.\n\nAnd has said by Arglanir, tell the range in which you can take the numbers.\n\nOh, and last, there's no need to know that's it's a power rule (which have no translation in french) since you provide the exact way for the derivation.",
