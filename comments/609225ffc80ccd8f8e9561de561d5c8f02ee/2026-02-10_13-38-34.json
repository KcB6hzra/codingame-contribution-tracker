    "content": "Well, I got 100% on all tests and 75% on submission, as so often happens.\nIt was, of course, validator 1, and I didn't bother to round up when dividing. It would have made sense to round up, but when I passed all tests, I simply submitted the code. Mayyybe it would be appropriate to have a test case that depends on rounding up?\nCG puzzles usually state that, if code passes a test, it will also pass that validator...",

Perhaps you should change it to something less ambiguous.\n\"An ASCII music bar stopped at the minute m.\" should be probably \"stopped at time m\".\nAlso please specify what kind of rounding is expected.",
