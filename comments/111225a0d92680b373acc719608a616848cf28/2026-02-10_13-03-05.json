I like this game because\n- easy to begin\n- probably difficult to be great\n- i like the gargoyle\n\nI do not know enough about how these games are made on codingame. Is it possible to add additional leagues after launch? I think this game should have more than one league for the final rule set. There will be a big skill gap.\n\nThank you for the fun game.",
