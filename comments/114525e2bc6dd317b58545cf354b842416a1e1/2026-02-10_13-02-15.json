    "content": "Hi, I have a few minor suggestions:\n\n* One of the guidelines reads \"Don't address the reader directly\" - the first paragraph could be changed to conform to this (but, to be honest, other contributions also disregard this guideline).\n\n*  As the draws are independent, their order is not relevant, so the following can be misleading: \"they occurred in the exact order observed\", since that's _not_ what you're asking to be calculated. This is somewhat corrected in the \"Note\" found later on in the text, but still should be substituted by something along the lines of \"You decide to observe the sequence of draws and calculate its probability (see note bellow).\" \n\n*  Add \"s\" in Input: A list of string ->  A list of strings \n\n* \"on\" -> \"to\" and \"draw\" -> \"draws\" in \"corresponding on the successive draw made\"",
