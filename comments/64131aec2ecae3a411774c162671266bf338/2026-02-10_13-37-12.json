Maybe you could also give tests and validators to check if this was understood correctly.\n\nMy solution in Python:\n\nlimit = int(input())\nmemo = {1:1}\ndef c(k):\n    if k in memo:\n        return memo[k]\n    if k % 2 == 0:\n        l = 1 + c(k//2)\n    else:\n        l = 1 + c(3*k+1)\n    memo[k] = l\n    return l\nprint(*max(\n    ((n,c(n)) for n in range(1,limit)),\n    key = lambda p:p[1]\n))",
