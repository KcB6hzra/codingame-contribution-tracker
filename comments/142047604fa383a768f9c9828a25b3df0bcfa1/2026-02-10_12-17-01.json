    "content": "Goal\n* Please clarify how the coordinate system works for this clash by specifying:\n  • which corner has the coordinates of 0,0 and\n  • the directions in which x- and y-coordinates increase.\n\nInput\n* Please format \"Line 1\", \"Next [[height]] lines\" and \"Last lines\" in <<bold>>.\n\n* Please replace \"digits\" with \"single-digit integers\".\n\n* Please add the word \"integer\" before \"coordinates\".\n\n* Please change \"Each coordinate is\" to \"Each cell's coordinates are\".\n\n* Please change \"{{x,y}}\" to \"[[x]]{{,}}[[y]]\".\n\nConstraints\n* Please remove the second constraint, as \"[[cell cost]]\" is not a defined variable name and the range need not be repeated (it's already specified in the Input section).\n\n* Please change \"2 coordinates\" to \"the coordinates of 2 cells\".\n\n* Please specify the maximum length of the path (in terms of the number of cells).\n\nStub generator\n* Please change Line 2 to:\nloop height loopline width cost:int\n\nCases\n* The following pairs of test and validator expect identical outputs. Please revise them so that the cases remain similar but expect different outputs:\n  • Simple Path (Test 1) and Basic Path (Validator 1)\n  • Zigzag Path (Test 2) and Curved Path (Validator 2)\n\n* The following cases include paths with non-adjacent cells, which violates the stated constraints. Please correct these cases:\n  • Long Journey (Test 3)\n  • Maximum Grid (Test 4)\n  • Complex Route (Validator 4)\n\n* Please add a new pair of cases where [[width]] > [[height]] and the path does not begin with 0,0.\n\n* Please add a new pair of cases where [[width]] < [[height]] and the path does not begin with 0,0.\n\nThanks.",
