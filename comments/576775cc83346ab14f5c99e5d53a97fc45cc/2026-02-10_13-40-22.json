I do not feel like I learned anything or had fun doing the exercise. As the title suggests, if I encountered this one in the clash rotation, I would only feel frustration.\n\nRegardless, I do appreciate your effort and the contribution to the community. If my reason for rejection does not match rejection guidelines I would like to be corrected.",

    "content": "I don't think \"rejection guidelines\" is a thing.\n\nI totally understand your reasoning. I do not enjoy those 'it just clicks' puzzles in the competitive environment too. What I do like is diving down into the complexity, steadily getting closer and closer to the answer.\nBut we are talking CoC Reverse here. 'It just clicks' is the essence of this mode. My puzzle doesn't use stub or test cases as hints, it does not use made-up formulas, it's not \"tests are so obvious that it becomes Fastest\". It expects from player what Reverse should be expecting - to study test cases and search for patterns.\nIn my opinion, for as long as Reverse exists - puzzles like this one should exist too.\n\nAlso, I appreciate your effort too! Have been seeing you lately reviewing some other puzzles.",
