Having all the numbers in the same line doesn't work. But it seems that having them in different lines works, so e.g. the Some Empty Silos test becomes:\n1200\n6 3\n300\n400\n200\nand the All Silos Empty test becomes:\n1200\n10 0<no newline here>\n<nothing below here>\n\nThe corresponding stub generator is like this:\nread N:int\nread Total_Silos:int Total_NonEmptySilos:int\nloop Total_NonEmptySilos read C:int\nwrite answer\n\nYou'll have to specify the number of non-empty silos to make this work though. But you don't have to add spaces or zeros for [[C]] any more, and it makes parsing nicer overall, because integers are passed to the player, instead of a string being passed.",
