    "content": "I've just noticed a bug that, curiously, was so in plain sight that it seems it went unnoticed: The initial number of pawns is not evenly distributed between both players. Although the counter shows 32 for both, the pink player always starts with more pawns (around 40 vs 24).\n\nhttps://www.codingame.com/replay/386729197\n\nIn this example, you can see that after the first step, the pink count suddenly jumps from 32 to 35, which by itself should be impossible.",

I don't know how to transfer this idea here, but I'll let you think about it :)\n\nEDIT : good thing that you moved to 8*8 :)",
