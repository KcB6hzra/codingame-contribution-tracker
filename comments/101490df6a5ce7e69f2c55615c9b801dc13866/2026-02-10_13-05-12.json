Even if you do wish to include it, perhaps at least make it the singular noun num rather than the plural noun nums since it is in reference to an individual entry from the array.  With it plural, my first instinct when quickly reading was that it might have been an array rather than an int.\n\nFor what its worth, I golfed the code down to 84 bytes in javascript after a first pass and might be able to golf further if I change my approach, so it might be worth considering it for shortest mode instead if desired.",

    "content": "Hi! I like the idea :) Simple in explanation, but not TOO simple in execution, as all clashes should be.\n\n(5DN1L is much better at me than this, and will probably be here soon with more insightful info, but I thought I'd try and help :] )\n\n\nCouple of suggestions so that it matches the format of most other clashes:\n\n*Goal\nI think you'll want to specify what you mean by \"missing from the array\". Saying something like \"Counting up from 1, what number's missing\". This might help comprehension when reading the clash quickly.\n\n* Input\nPlease specify that the array is \"A single unsorted array of space-separated integers\"\n\nYou'll want to format 'nums' as a variable by placing \"[[]]\" on either side, like this [[nums]], wherever it's mentioned. This helps clashers know that it's a variable, and allows them to quickly skim, read, and comprehend your clash.\n\nPlease move \"(1<= | nums | <= 1000)\"  to \"Constraints\".\nAlso, since you mention that it can be both positive and negative integers, you'll want to extend your range. Looking at the test cases, I'd personally format it like this:\n-100 <= [[nums]] <= 100.\n\nI also believe that the second sentence would fit better in the Goal, but I don't think it's an issue leaving it there. \n\nIn the input, you'll want to include every variable given to the clasher. Including the count variable. So, it'd look a bit like this:\n<<Line 1>>: [[numsCount]] an integer.\n<<Line 2>>: [[nums]] An string of space-separated integers of [[count]] length.\n\n*Output\nYou'll want to make sure that nums has the variable markers here as well.\n\n*Test Cases:\nYou'll want your test cases to be different from the validators. They need to be slightly different to avoid hard-coded solutions from working based on whatever the input is.\nThey should be similar, but slightly different with differing outputs.\n\nI hope this helps! I'm still learning as well, so some of the information I gave may be slightly wrong, and I'm sure someone can help by correcting me ;P\n\n\n\nSide note---\nI think this clash would be good for Shortest, if you'd like to add that to the game modes.\nIf you include some more test cases early on that cover differing possibilities, then reverse could also work for this clash.\n\nThanks!",

They need to be similar, but with different outputs to avoid hard coded solutions. I'm not 100% that it would be a good fit for reverse, but I think with more test cases, it'd be fine.
