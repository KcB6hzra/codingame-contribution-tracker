The statement is very concise :)\nI personally like it that way, some might like to have a back story.\n\nI lost some hairs trying to solve it.\nI would approve it if I could get past the final tests.\nI'll try later on if it is not approved by someone else then.\n\nKeep up the good ideas Nagrarok !",

In both puzzles, I see people prying for a heuristic approach to solve the puzzle while there exists an algorithmic solution that is both faster and more relevant.\nSeriously, a good think for novice is to learn algorithmic first, and  then algorithmic for IA.\n\nSecond, the limit time is not 5s but depend on the language in use.\n\nFinally, you ask for people to do the review job while you vote and get the XP. This is unacceptable!",
