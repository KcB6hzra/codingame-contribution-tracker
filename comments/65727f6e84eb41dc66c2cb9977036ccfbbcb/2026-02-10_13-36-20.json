    "content": "Interesting clash.\n\nThe weird part for me is that the fuel in the tank is still included in the cost of the trip, but I guess even if you don't have to refuel the fuel is still worth money, so the trip isn't free even if you don't spend any money on the trip.\n\nEveryone in my clash failed besides a bot that got 100%.\nI got 100% on test cases but 50% on validators. Honestly my code had lots of errors with the calculation of 'n', but your test cases were too easy and didn't cause issues.\nhttps://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/41467274bd3b0d276ddfd39c43062f22591f582\n\nBad Ruby code below (only fails Validators 'Test 4' and 'Test 8'):\nd,f,V,s,c=$<.map &:to_i\nputs \"%d %d\"% [c*F=d*((s-80)**2/400+6)/1e2, ((F-f)/V).ceil]\n\nYou really need more test-validator pairs, I think.",

    "content": "Missing in the statement the fact that cost has to be rounded down but worse :\nBecause inputs and outputs are int you can't think as a player of rounded issue. In fact in that kind of problem, most of the time, test cases are choosen so that number remain integers. This is because nothing in the statement state otherwise.\nSo last validator is unfair because is the only one where float is needed.\n\nAlso in your solution why do you round down liters_in_tank ? This can lead to approximation error. But it seems here that it does not affect validity of test cases.\n\nWith all that words you should : \n- precise float and rounded expected. Maybe read float so that player are forced to manage rouding.\n- change test 7 so that it reflect test 8 (validator) about rounding issue\n- change test 4 so that it reflect test 5 (validator) which is the only one where the total liters needed is less that the liters in tank\n- keep the name of validator validator !\n\nAnd in my opinion this is not a good clash. Just applying a random math formula is not about programming. Hope the next contribution will take these words into account !",

    "content": "I would start by creating a new validator for each of your current test cases (so in the end you'll have 8 tests and 8 validators) such that they check for the same things. In this case this is pretty complicated because you have so many variables. For example in \"Test 1\" you have n=0.12 before rounding and in its corresponding validator (that you have labeled \"Test 2\") you have n=0.0 so they're not testing for the same thing at all. \"Test 1\" is testing that you round up, while \"Test 2\" can be passed by rounding up, down, *or* to the nearest integer. This will cause solutions that do math.floor(n+1) instead of math.ceil(n) to fail the hidden validator even though it passes all the other tests.\n\nOther tests have similar issues but with other variables. \"Test 5\" is the only one where liters_in_tank is greater than liters_needed (there is no validator for that case at all!). If you're having a hard time coming up with equivalent validators you could try only changing one variable between a test and its validator (as an example the test could have cost=3 and in the validator cost=4, but everything else stays the same).",
