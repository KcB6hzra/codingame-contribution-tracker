    "content": "Nice clash, but at this moment I am slightly confused:\n- N is the amount [number] of people in the family tree. But it also happens to be the number of lines following after N (that you use as loop in the stub) - but of these lines the final one is different from the rest.\nWith the current input, it is slightly annoying that I want to use .split() to the input in the loop, but that gives an error for the final line.\n\nI kind of expected the following input:\nn for number of parents\nnext n lines: parent child\np for the person for which you need to find offspring,\ni.e. the following stub (with N being number of parents, not number of people):\nread N:int\nloop N read relationship:string(100)\nread P:int\nwrite Offspring",

    "content": "Thanks for the comment, I had the loop like that because the stub generator didn't allow me to loop through N - 1. The way to fix this would be saying that N accounts for all the people excluding person 1 (the root parent), however I'm worried that doing that will add too much complexity to the prompt and only serve confuse the coder. If you have any suggestions for how to approach this better, I would greatly appreciate them.",

    "content": "Ah I see your point; I thought for a moment N could be number of parents, but there are of course multiple entries for a single parent.\n\nWhat about 'a family tree with N branches, each branch consisting out of two persons: parent and child'. All persons have a unique label'. Then you don't specify the number of persons, but that is also not a fundamental piece of the puzzle I think.",
