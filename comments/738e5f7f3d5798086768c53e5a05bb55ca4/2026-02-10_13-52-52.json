Without it there is no example print nor info about the stderr print.\nAnd I will repeat myself about max value, and constraining values to natural numbers (which allows you to use them as table indices and speed up things instead using dictionaries).\n\nThe puzzle is really doable by deterministic search in no-time. Actually I optimized things a little (C#) so the 'big' cases used around 400 calls and <20 ms. The 'normal' tests were worse for my solution (~2500 calls and time 700~1150), all the other < 100ms.",
