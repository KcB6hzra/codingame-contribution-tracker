    "content": "Seems like it'd be a decent CoC challenge, although one thing you might want to consider:\n\nMy initial solution converted to a binary (string) and would have hit array indexing errors if there was any need to left-pad the binary representation with zeros (there was no need in the existing tests). This is fine so long as any validation post-submit validation tests are similarly lenient about not requiring any left-padding to pass\n\nAn example test that would have hit an error with my first go at it is below, which I think matches your description of an \"ASCII printable character\". I'd suggest either stating that it's a letter of the alphabet (no need to worry that there's less than 7 bits as A=65=b1000001)\n\nn=129068\nfalse\n6\n1\n?\n\n:)",
