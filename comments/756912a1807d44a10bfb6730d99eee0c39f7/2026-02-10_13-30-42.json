Sure, it can be figured out but the fact that music notes go back to \"A\" after \"G\" may be confusing for some. A person who does know how to read music will have an advantage for sure.\n\nOtherwise I love the concept!",

I don't think there is any way of avoiding this kind of advantage as it would probably come into play for fastest to some extent as well... Let me know if you think it should be only fastest or if that change could be enough to make it OK. Thanks for the feedback!",

    "content": "I think that the first 2 test cases should clue the player in a bit better. Like make the first one \"ABCDEFG\" and the very next either \"FGABCDE\" or \"GFEDCBA\".\n\nRealistically, not every reverse mode clash starts everyone off on level playing ground. As an example:\n\nInput: 4   Output: 24\nInput: 5   Output: 120\n\nThis would be near impossible if someone didn't know factorial. Granted, math is more commonly known among coders than music lol.\n\nI think if you adjust the first couple of test cases it should be fine.",
