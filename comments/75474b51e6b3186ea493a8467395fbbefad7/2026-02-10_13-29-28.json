    "content": "The puzzle ought to be solvable just by following the ruleset in the description.  At the moment \"collapse patches\" is slightly under-defined.\n\nI think you should add to rule #2 to define \"collapse patches\" in some way.  Perhaps you could say \"if all remaining possible, overlapping 3x3 patches contain the same symbol in a block position, that block is constrained to that symbol\".  Or however you would word it.\n\nMy previous code attempt was looking for entire 3x3 patches and would only \"constrain\" the block symbols when I had one possible 3x3 patch remaining for that position.\n\nI now see that WFC is more focussed on the possible symbols in a block position (implied by the overlapping possible 3x3 patches).\n\nUsing the revised version of the \"constrain\" instruction I was able to resolve the partial solution for \"Widen The Picture [test]\".\n\nNow my (naive) code attempt simply needs to be faster so it doesn't time out!",
