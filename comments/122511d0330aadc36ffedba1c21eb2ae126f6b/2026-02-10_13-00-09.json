    "content": "The triangles in Large Oblique and Validator 8 are not valid, which can be seen in the significant deviation from the equality implied by the Law of Cosines (or you can see that c > a, b and realize that C < 60º is absurd). More pedantically, only the equilateral and right triangles are actually valid.\nI suggest increasing the number of significant figures in the input values and ensuring that the answers mod 0.01 are not anywhere near 0.005 to protect CodinGamers from rounding errors. Alternatively, either c or theta should be omitted so that there is there is no possibility of a contradiction between input values.",

Would love clarification on the matter. Thanks",
