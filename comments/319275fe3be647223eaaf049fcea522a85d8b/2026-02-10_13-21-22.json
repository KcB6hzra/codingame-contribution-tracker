    "content": "Thank you for your feedback! I believe the complexity of having only the side lenght instead of the vertices radically decreases the solving time. Besides, the puzzle also asks for the angle nature and location of the notable angle, so I think it's quite different from that one. As per my suggested solution, I think it's achievable.",
