No matter whether to iterate over 'input().split()' or just over the 'input()'. Thought the diagrams with spaces are visually more appealing to look at :)",

Yes python can handle both cases, but the meaning was, that from the technical point of view I do not care if the spaces are there or not, but it is aesthetically more pleasing to view the statement and the tests when the spaces are included.",
