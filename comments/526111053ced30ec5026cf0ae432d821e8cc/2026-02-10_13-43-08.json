    "content": "Hi, great problem. I have a few critiques.\n\n1. As Niako pointed out, excess armor warrants a completely unnecessary check, but if you want to keep the game aspect that's fine I guess.\n\n2. Again as Niako said, probably Medium difficulty is better.\n\n3. Maybe add \"Mathematics\" or \"Arithmetic\" tag, the problem basically requires sorting by a particular value (probably shouldn't reveal).",
