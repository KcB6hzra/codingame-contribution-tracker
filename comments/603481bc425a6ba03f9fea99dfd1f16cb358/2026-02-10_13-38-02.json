    "content": "Very nice for a first contribution!\n\nThe difficulty seemed just fine to me.\n\nThe input field should only be used to describe the type of data you are reading.\nYou should instead use the statement field to describe how the puzzle works.\n\nThere is a typo in your stub input, it should be \nloopline recipeLength ingredient:int\nDon't forget to populate the constraints field as well.\n\nI think the statement  \"The machine stops as soon as there is not enough space to store a new arrival.\" is a bit misleading since from what I've seen in my solution the machine actually tries to bake a cake first, and only stops if it could not. I think the statement implies the machine will stop without trying to bake a cake, but perhaps that's just because my English is not that good ^^\".\n\nAlso, it is implied, but maybe for the sake of clarity you should specify that all the given ingredients are in the recipe (ie there are no useless ingredients) since it was not obvious to me the first time I read the statement.\n\nOtherwise a very good start.",
