Which is the limit in the constraints.\n\nYou can either keep the constraint and allow brute force approach.\nOr extend the constraint. In this last case I would go for way bigger number like a million to forbid brute force.\nNote that forbidding the brute force may not fit the clash of code format.\n\nI solved first all the test cases using brute force (adding new elements in an actual set one by one). Then (after I saw your solution) I came with a O(n) one liner. \nI am not entirely sure that I would have found this second solution under 5 min. So I am against preventing brute force in this case.",

    "content": "It is doable and could be fun. \n\nSome points have to be fixed:\n- The chosen element are not removed from the array. This was not clear.\n- Actually, you are not playing with an array but a set (I can add an infinite amount of 1 in an array, so the answer is always infinite).\n- Why 0 is not a valid number? In the example my set is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ,6}. You have to specify that the 2 elements are different or accept the 0.\n\nWhat is the link with particle simulation? A bit of story would be funnier and actually clearer. For example:\nIn this universe, each \"molecule\" is represented by a number. \nYou can combine two molecules by finding the absolute difference of their numbers. \nGiven a infinite amount of starting molecules, how many different molecules are possible?",
