Unless the 4 alphabets are provided as inputs with a stub, it would be very irritating to be racing to copy and paste a bunch of text under time pressure.\n\nI also don't think that short & concise solutions should disqualify this from being a puzzle. It's also easy, but that's what easy puzzles are supposed to be.\n\nEDIT:\nForgot to mention: Validators 5 and 9 are problematic. If I'm correct in assuming the significance of tests 10 and 11 is in testing the solution for words that appear in more than one phonetic alphabet, then there is a problem with the words \"Quebec\" and \"Charlie\" being included in validator 5 and validator 9, respectively.",
