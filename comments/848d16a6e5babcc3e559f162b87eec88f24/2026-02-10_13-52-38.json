    "content": "There are a couple of things that I think could improve this problem:\n\n1. I think the original phrasing of the problem statement is a little unclear. In mathematical terms, all the problem wants is the solution to\n        f(x, n) = x! / (x - n)!\nHowever, your description makes a strong assumption about HOW the coder is going to implement \"the calculation of x!\", which can be done in a few different ways. For example:\n        x! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * (x - 2) * (x - 1) * x\n        x! = x * (x - 1) * (x - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1\nand even\n        x! = x * 2 * (x - 1) * 3 * ... * (x / 2)\nare all VALID ways to calculate \"x!\" (though the third example is admittedly contrived), which means in answering what this questions asks: \"... the first 3 steps of the calculation of 6!\"-- could just as easily be answered correctly as 120 = 6 * 5 * 4 OR 6 = 1 * 2 * 3.\n\nI would recommend rephrasing the problem to ask for the solution in unambiguous terms:\n\"You are given two numbers, <code>X</code> and <code>N</code>. The output should be the value <code>X! / (X - N)!</code>\n\n2. The problem constraints aren't really viable. The factorial function grows EXTREMELY quickly: providing an X equal to 111 as you state would overflow the primitive data types in whatever language the person is using.  A quick google search for \"21!\" shows that it already exceeds the maximum value of an unsigned 64-bit integer: \"2&65 - 1\"\n\nI would recommend restricting X so that coders don't have to worry about integer overflow. Since you're most familiar with Javascript, you probably want to make sure X is no larger than 18 since 18! can be stored comfortably in a double-precision floating point variable.\n\nNext: I find the double-constraint on N distasteful. The fact that you need an extra \"if N >= X - 1\" constraint is a sign that you really shouldn't allow N to BE greater than X. It's not a core part of the problem you're trying to ask, so you should change the constraint so that the coders can focus on that core problem.\n\nAll in all, I recommend the following revised constraints:\n0 < X <= 18\n0 < N <= X\n\n3. Your solution is correct, but more complicated than it needs to be. (Refer back to my note that \"there's more than one way to calculate a factorial, so it doesn't make sense to ask for 'a certain number of steps'.\") If you rethink the question in the way I recommended, there's a much shorter, clearer JS solution:\n1>    let x = parseInt(readline());\n2>    let xMinusN = Math.max(1, x - parseInt(readline()));\n3>    let p = 1;\n4>    while (x > xMinusN) {\n5>        p *= x--;\n6>    }\n7>    print(p);\nYou'll probably also find that most people implementing it would go for the straight loop as well. Note that if you choose to adopt my recommended constraints, line 2 could be replaced with\n2>    let xMinusN = x - parseInt(readline());",

    "content": "Your example is misleading because it could also be interpreted as 6!/3! or X!/N!. Also rephrase \"The second one N, the limit where the calculation of X! should stop.\" into something like \"The second input is N. N is the number of iterations the calculation of X! should make\". To me your phrasing implies that the calculation of X! should stop at value N and not after N iterations.\nAlso your Test 4 and Validator 5 should probably output 1 instead of 3. Either way you haven't defined 0 iterations and I guess there also isn't a mathematical definition for that (except for maybe n!/n!=1, but very likely it is just undefined). \nWill give a upvote if all is fixed.",

    "content": "4. The example you give in the problem statement is ambiguous. At a glance, there's two ways to interpret what the problem is asking:\n        (1) f(x, n) = x! / (x - n)! -- the correct answer\n        (2) f(x, n) = x! / n!       -- if you don't read closely enough\nThe problem is, in your example, both interpretations give the same answer. For x=6 and n=3:\n        (1) f(6, 3) = 6! / (6 - 3)! = 6 * 5 * 4 = 120\n        (2) f(6, 3) = 6! / 3! = 6 * 5 * 4 = 120\nIt'll be helpful to the coders playing the problem if you help them catch that mistake quickly. I'd recommend changing the example to x=6, n=4 with the answer 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 = 360.\n\n5. Your test cases and validation cases really don't match each other. You should try to align them so that they test the same things, so that the coders aren't surprised by errors that suddenly appear after they submit. I'd recommend something like\n\nTest 1 (repeat the example):\nf(6, 4) = 360\nValidator 1\nf(6, 2) = 30\n\nTest 2 (test \"X = N\"):\nf(4, 4) = 24\nValidator 1\nf(5, 5) = 120\n\nTest 3 (something to help people understand the pattern in reverse mode)\nf(7, 3) = 210\nValidator 3\nf(7, 4) = 840\n\nTest 4 (small numbers)\nf(2, 1) = 2\nValidator 3\nf(1, 1) = 1\n\nTest 5 (big numbers)\nf(18, 18) = 6402373705728000\nValidator 4\nf(18, 16) = 3201186852864000\n\nTest 6 (an interesting case since the answers are the same)\nf(10, 9) = 3628800\nValidator 5\nf(10, 10) = 3628800\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOverall, I think it's a good problem and there's plenty of room to explore it in Reverse and Shortest modes-- it'd be fun. But it's important to make sure the statement is clear, and the test cases comprehensive.",
