Some follow-ups:\n\n- I'm not sure what you mean by inverting validator 1 and test 2 (now validator 2 and test 1, I've inverted the two first pairs because the full sentence demonstrates better what input should be received)? Test/validator 1 demonstrate the use of StrInv \"in a sentence\", and test/validator 2 is \"alone\".\n\n- I've now explicited \"that may contain a single StrInv function call\". What about now? :-)\n\n- I've removed the \"You must not escape the result\" mention, as you're right, it was confusing. Instead, I've just added more examples to demonstrate what I meant.",
