    "content": "I only have one big qualm with the puzzle: there's no indication of how to handle multiple rows of the table. When I tried to code the solution, I had no idea what the purpose of multiple rows was, so my program failed starting from the second test case onwards as I didn't understand you needed to add the row number as well. Trying to decipher the code in my head using Test case #2 (Alphabet) to figure out what went wrong is also headache-inducing, since the case is far more complex than case #1.\n\nI recommend using a 2x2 comparison table for the example in the prompt, and then inserting a Test Case #2 that has 2 rows and perhaps 8 characters. Incidentally, you use \"line\" instead of \"row\" in your example.",
