For more experienced programmers it is a satisfyingly quick  problem that builds confidence. Something to warm up on before tackling something more involved.",

I like to see Title Case for test case names, but I've never seen that presented as a Codingame standard.  Still, please consider it.\n\nI'd also like to see the title of your puzzle be in title case: Roman Sorting\n\nWell done!",

Title Case applied to puzzle and test names.\n\nI wavered on whether to submit it as Easy or Medium, but figured if a Medium player gets a puzzle that's a bit too easy, they'll knock out the answer quickly and move on to the next one; if a beginner gets a too-hard Easy puzzle, they might walk away from coding.",
