My only concern is that my mother language is not included (despite being in latin script with some extra chars), but I cannot hold a grudge just because of this :-)",

The final comment could perhaps be placed at the beginning, stating that there are many ways to determine the language of a text, such as using stopwords. However, in this puzzle, the focus is on the application of rules, etc. My personal opinion is that, being at the end of the text, it almost seems like an alternative way to solve the problem.\nI also think it's a medium-level problem, because the problem involves UTF-8 manipulation and the reduction of multiple candidates",
