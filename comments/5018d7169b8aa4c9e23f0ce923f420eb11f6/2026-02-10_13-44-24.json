Also, looks more 'easy' than 'medium' for me, being quite simple string manipulation, but if a language has no binary to decimal conversion, that makes it a bit longer.",

    "content": "This puzzle was fun!\n\nI took a pass editing the statement for grammar. (Not sure if I can just edit the changes in.)\n---\n\nYou have been looking on the network [[packet]] a game is sending, and you have been thinking about making a system to automatically pick things up for you!\n\nYou have found the [[packet]] is one big string of binary data of instructions.\nEach instruction is formatted in this way:\n<<[instruction id (3 bits)][packet length (4 bits)][packet info (packet length bits)]>>.\n\nWhat you need to do is extract the item drop instructions, they have id <<101>>, and their <<packet info>> is the item id you will need! This id might be different lengths, so look at the <<packet length>>.\n\nWhat you need to send back is a set of pickup instructions, id <<001>>. Remember the packet length!\n<<001[item id length][item id]>>\n\nFor example: \"10100010101001011\" we have the id and length:\n\"101 0001 0101001011\" which means we should take 1 bit for the item id, so\n\"101 0001 0\".\n Then we look at the rest of the packet\n\"101001011\" and split that up into \"101 0010 11\" and get the second id \"11\".\n\nThen we just send the response \"001 0001 0\" and \"001 0010 11\".",

    "content": "Sorry my comment was unclear. Here's what I meant:\n\nIn the \"In between\" test, we need to split the input into 11100011, 101001011, 0010011101  where only the middle piece is used. The beginning and end are garbage.\n\nThe \"more than 1 drop\" test is obviously from the title meant to be split into two useful pieces and no garbage. But there is an alternative way to split it such that there is only one useful piece in the middle, surrounded by garbage.\n\nSince an algorithm doesn't read the titles, it has no way of knowing which type of input it's getting in each case.\n\nWe could set an algorithm to use the first \"101\" it finds and then skip ahead to the end of that instruction. But that would skip too far ahead on an input like \"10110100010\".\n\nAnd it also doesn't pick out the same sequences you want in your \"that is a long one\" test. The first valid sequence there is \"1011001010100111\"",
