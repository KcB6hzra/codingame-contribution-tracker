    "content": "There is, indeed, a mathematical trick! I'll probably write a description of it in detail at some point, but essentially it involves dividing the fractal into \"levels\" according to the maximum power of P that will fit within each horizontal and vertical range (so if R = C = 40 and P = 3, the maximum power that can fit within the fractal is 3^3 = 27). The total number of shaded cells for any level n is always (1 + 2 + 3... + P)^n, so these values can easily be precomputed and summed up in O(n) time. \n\nThat's all the easy part. :) From here, there are two particularly challenging aspects of the problem:\n\n1: Handling cases where R is not a power of P.\n2: Handling cases where C != R.\n\nFor cases where R is not a power of P but C = R, let P^k be the highest power of P that can fit within R rows. Once we've found a k such that P^(k + 1) > R, we then count all the shaded cells up until row P^k, and then find the maximum value y such that P^k * y <= R (with y being an integer in the range [1 to P]). We add the counts for these rows and then reduce R by P^k * y (think of it as if we're \"chopping off the top\" of the triangle). This method is executed recursively, reducing the size of the triangle at each step until we've reached level -1.\n\nWhen R != C, we essentially do the same thing horizontally by finding the maximum multiple x of P^k that fits within the width of the triangle (P^k * x <= C). This is the part of the problem where things start to get pretty complicated, since you need to be quite careful about combining the counts of the different horizontal and vertial \"cuts\" of the fractal without over-counting. The recursive calls can also get quite expensive here, so DP/memoization is necessary. \n\nThe implementation of all of this can be found in the Solve() function of my solution code.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the feedback!",

I'm pretty new around here, though.  Maybe there's an understanding about trusting a reference solution if it agrees with a naive solution on smaller values?  That's my plan, anyway, and you can expect approval from me soon if that goes well.",
