    "content": "Thx for the quick feedback :)\n\nI fixed the typos, and mentioned the sequence  should be space-separated in output description.\n\nI changed the statement and removed the \"at most 8 numbers\" stuff : I was concerned the sequence might be very long, but after further researches it looks like the sequence remains short for number <= 1000. The whole sequence up to 1 should be outputed for happy numbers. The sequence up to a loop for sad numbers.\n\nI was not sure if the \"4 16\" and \"7 49\" starts could be enough to guess the square computation, and find the trick without statements. I disabled this mode after your feedback.\n\nThanks again :)",
