    "content": "Goal\n* Please simplify the Goal section, keeping the statement concise and focused. This is especially important for a clash of code, as a short, clear description helps player solve the clash faster. Avoid unnecessary story elements, or complex words (especially for non-native English speakers).\n\nInput\n* Next H lines: Consider revising the description to make it clearer and easier to follow:\n\n<<Next [[H]] lines>>: A [[W]]-character string denoting a line of the island. Only these characters are used:\n• {{O}} = landing spot (starting point)\n• {{X}} = Treasure of Cortés (target)\n• {{o}} = land\n• {{x}} = fake treasure\n\n* Please change \"Line H+2\" to \"Next line\".\n\n* Please format \"step(s)\" like this: {{step}}({{s}}).\n\nConstraints\n* If you use the revised wording above, the second map constraint can be removed.\n\n* Given the second instruction constraint is there, [[steps]] < [[W]], [[H]] may be omitted. In fact, some cases violate this part of the inequality. (I think your original intention was to compare horizontal and vertical steps separately with [[W]] and [[H]]. By the way, the cases where [[W]] = 1 or [[H]] = 1 also violate the constraint.) In turn, the first input ranges constraint may be changed to 1 ≤ [[W]], [[H]], [[steps]] ≤ 30 instead.\n\n* Please remove the first instruction constraint to avoid repetition.\n\n* Consider dropping the third instruction constraint; it's helpful but not critical.\n\nStub generator / input\n* Please read my separate comment in your discussion with @shazman below.\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "The idea for this puzzle is good, but the starter code needs work. Right now it has placeholder prints and unused imports that should be removed. The input format is read wrong because each instruction has three parts like “1 step South,” but the script only tries to read two, so it breaks. You need to read the number, skip “step(s),” and then take the direction. A loop should be added to find the starting O on the map, use a dictionary for directions, and move step by step instead of skipping the count. The outputs should match the rules: “Chase after them!” if the crew lands on X, “Find the real treasure!” if they land on x, or “They’ll be back.” otherwise. The puzzle idea itself is fun and has a nice theme, but fixing the starter code will make it smoother and less confusing for people who try it.",

    "content": "Hi, thanks for trying my clash! Just to clarify:\n\n- The placeholder prints were intentionally left there so that clashers can copy-paste the respective output lines wherever necessary. It helps save time on Fastest/Reverse mode :)\n\n- Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do about the unused imports. The stub generator is the one responsible for importing the libraries and this is standardised across all clashes / puzzles.\n\n- You mention that the script only tries to read two of the three parts and hence it breaks. May I know where the breakage occurs, and in which language? I've tested the stub generator by simply running the code without editing it, and it fails due to the multiple lines of output but doesn't actually break (throw an error). Same for skipping the \"step(s)\"; the stub generator should handle that already.\n\n- The starting O on the map is always at (0, 0) - this is listed in the constraints section :)\n\n- May I know what you mean by \"move step by step instead of skipping the count\"? Could you also let me know how a dictionary for directions could be useful for you here? I'm not quite sure I follow.\n\n- The outputs SHOULD match the rules. Are there any test cases that do not? Also note that the crew has to *end up* at the exact location after following *all* of the instructions step by step - this is in the output section :)\n\nMy apologies if any of this is unclear; do let me know what the issues are for you and I'll try my best to fix them!",

I see the confusion now.\n\nThe way that the starter code is generated on CodinGame is through their in-built stub generator, which is essentially a very high-level keyword parser that tries to convert keywords into language-specific syntax. Unfortunately, what this means is that us puzzle creators have little control over the way that the starter code is generated. And yes, I don't love it (you can see that my solution doesn't use it at all). But I guess it wasn't meant to cater to specific languages.\n\nWhat I tried to do in the stub generator is to specifically label the middle \"step(s)\" portion of each instruction as \"Ignore\". What this looks like in the stub generator:\n\nfor i in range(s):\n    inputs = input().split()\n    steps = int(inputs[0])\n    ignore = inputs[1]\n    direction = inputs[2]\n\nUnfortunately, this is the most verbose way of labelling the inputs that I can think of, given the limitations of the stub generator.

This clash is not meant to be complicated, and I didn't want to give off that idea :)\n\n- In terms of speed, hardcoding each of the 4 known directions (exhaustive) is much faster :)\n\nBut of course, there is nothing wrong with your approach.

That said, splitting the instruction into three variables and explicitly naming one `ignore` feels like it goes a little too far.\n\nTwo possible alternatives to simplify this:\n\n1. Remove \"step(s)\" from the input: then there's no need for an `ignore` variable at all, and the hints in the stub may be simplified as well.\n\n2. Keep the instruction as a single string, and let players decide how to parse it themselves.\n\nHope this helps.",
