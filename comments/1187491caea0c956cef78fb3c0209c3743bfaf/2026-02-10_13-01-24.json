It doesn't feel like it goes with the rest of a statement and feels more like an additional edge case (when the invalid input edge case was good enough)...\n\nTo be honest if base=0 was also considered invalid input, I would approve the problem, however as it stands, for me it doesn't make sense to have that edge case.",
