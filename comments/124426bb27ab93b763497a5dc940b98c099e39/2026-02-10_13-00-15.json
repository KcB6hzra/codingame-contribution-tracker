    "content": "Just played this clash. Half the players submitted solutions with < instead of <= and got 100% on the tests but only 50% on the validators. This ruins the clash. Please make the tests consistent with the validators, especially since the distinction between < and <= according to the problem statement is somewhat implicit: most non-native English speakers can't be expected to know whether \" the team's combined power exceeds P\" is true or not when the team's combined power is exactly P.",

    "content": "Nice clash, but the tests are not good currently.\n\nValidator 2 and Validator 3 are the only cases that test for [[integer]] = [[P]]. This is the core edge case of the clash and it's not covered in tests, which means clashers who don't code it correctly can get 100% on tests and then only 50% on validators.\n\nI suggest creating a new test/validator pair and perhaps swapping Validator 2 with Test 3.",
