    "content": "The puzzle is great. The description is OK, but can be improved upon in my opinion. I also suggest leaving out the reference to pythagorean distances and the way of calculating the lengths as both are parts of resolving the puzzle. I will upvote if this is updated.\n\nBelow my suggestion for description:\n\nGoal\nYou must output the length of a race track, given a number of coordinates. If the track has 2 coordinates, they represent  a start and finish line. If the track has 3 coordinates or more, the first coordinate represents the start/finish, while the others represent checkpoints that are required to be passed through in order.\n\nNotes\nOnce the track length is calculated, it should be returned as a whole number.\nThe distances between coordinates are always a straight line.",
