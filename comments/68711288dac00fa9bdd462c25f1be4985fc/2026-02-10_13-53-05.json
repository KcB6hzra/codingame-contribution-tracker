I plugged in what I thought were \"the default parameters\" into the neural network and only the last two gave me trouble.  I also don't know if you could provide an explanation of what more/less/different hidden layers do.  (More layers or nodes seems to help, but it also increases the computation time.  Maybe that is all there is too it.)",

I am thinking about patterns like Conway's Game of Life or simpler patterns, like the shift-left map, where the state of the cell at stage n+1 is a function of the state of the cell plus eight surrounding cells at stage n.  (Does the input size have to be a power of 2?  If so find patterns which only depend on the surrounding 8 cells.)  (Have cells outside of the grid count as a 0, or alternately have the grid wrap around like a torus--a la the Astroids game.)  Show the user a few frames of a small grid and have them use the neural network to predict the next grid frame.",

    "content": "I thought about this idea some more and implemented some of it.  It seems to work.  The neural network can successfully predict various automata rules.  One however needs to make sure it is interesting for a least some cases.  For many rules and initial configurations of the grid, a lookup table suffices.  There are only 2**9 = 512 inputs and many of the needed ones come up in the training data.  However with a complicated rule like the Game of Life, there are configurations that never come up in the training data (assuming I start with a random starting pattern), yet the network can still predict that, say, an empty cell surrounded by 4 live cells stays empty even if it hasn't seen that exact configuration before.  So I think it is a promising problem.  (It doesn't do as well on the game High Life, since it has trouble recognizing the outlier 6-neighbor case.)",
