    "content": "This is a cool, original clash. But I think the wording is a bit unclear.\n\nIt would be good to clarify that 'upside-down' really means 'rotated by 180 degrees', I got this in a clash and spent time first just assuming that all the keys were swapped so that Q<->Z, W<->X, etc.\n\nAlso you say the middle row is \"ASDFGHJKL;456 (even if it's upside down)\", but that's a bit misleading, because once it's rotated 180 degrees it becomes \";LKJHGFDSA654\". I think that line is part of what led me to think it was just a vertical mirroring of the keys rather than a rotation.\n\nI came first of 4 in my clash, finishing in 5m18s. 2/4 got 0% and 1/4 got 50%. I think clarifying the wording could help make it more solvable. https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/37890735b2861cd6dad5b05dced06b3c664646b",
