It is an important skill that should be tested in contests.\n\n(P/M I only test it in Js. Asking me to test in all languages doesn't make sense. Not many people can actually do that right)",

You could make it more like a real rocket by starting it at 0m/s with continuous acceleration, that way your solution still works.\n\nYou should give an upper bound for n, perhaps 10000. Enough to get your rocket to orbit, without integer overflows.",
