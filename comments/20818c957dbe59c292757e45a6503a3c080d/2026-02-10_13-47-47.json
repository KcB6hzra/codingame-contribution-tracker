I think it will create an issue only for the encryption/decryption stage (this Key computation is only a part of the Diffie-Hellman Key exchange protocol, maybe maths would be broken with a wrong starting point... but this is out of my knowledge for now).",

Furthermore (and coincidentally), as opposite y values <=> opposite in the curve group, and as the puzzle only asks for x values, they both lead to the exact same results.\n\nAlso, your __mul__() starts by taking n % self.curve.p which makes no sense as the order of G is not P. It does not matter as anyway n<P in the inputs. Yet the order of G is actually 4602044433557404549 (i.e. the smallest k such that kG=0, or the size of the cycle if you prefer) which looks incredibly close to P=4602044434169447761.\nI don't know if someone has an explanation for that?!\nEdit: The explanation is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse%27s_theorem_on_elliptic_curves : the difference between P and the curve size is always O(sqrt(P)).",

Having the point out of the curve will lead to wrong points calculation but that's it (for here).\n\nFor the second point, it seems that x² = k mod P has only 2 points only if P is Prime (which is the case here) and yes they are opposites.\n\nfor the __mul__(), there is a modulo because you can multiply it more than P times but I think it makes no sense (I'll have a try with a very small P). You may end up at the same point maybe ?\n\nQuestion : How did you get all that knowledge about number theory :) ?",

    "content": "For your first point, the formulas are derived from a proper geometrical operation (in an abstract algebraic context, but still) assuming the points are on the curve. Applied to points that are not on the curve, these formulas make no sense. Hence for the problem to be solvable when G is not on the curve, you would have to prove that these formulas are still symmetric and associative \"enough\" so that, regardless of the order in which you do the operations, you get the same result. I've absolutely not thought about it, yet this does not look completely obvious. Right?\n\nFor the third point, the iterations of G indeed form a cycle, the right modulo to use is the size of this cycle, which is the number I gave in my previous post.\n\nFor the number theory knowledge: a bit of math/theoretical studies, a bit of Project Euler and a bit of personal taste I guess.\n\nI have a suggestion for the \"next puzzle\": basically simply a reverse puzzle of this one (given kG, find k, by an attack on the discrete log, e.g. baby-step giant-step or Pollard's rho probabilistic attack, or anything else).\n\nFinally I will validate if you take into account my remarks (replace the points P/Q by A/B and say something about the 0 element and the case Xp=Xq, otherwise this will end up with complains on the forum from people who can't solve the problem relying on the statement only).",
