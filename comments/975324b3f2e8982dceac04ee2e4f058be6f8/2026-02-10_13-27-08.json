Honestly, even with the added explanation of what \"windingcount\" means, I still don't really understand what it is or how it affects the problem. Also, I'm not sure I understand how what the relevance of \"distance\" is exactly. How do you know when the dogs see each other? If one dog's distance from the target is significantly shorter and they reach the destination before the others are within range, are they therefore excluded from further consideration? I think the way it's currently explained leaves a lot up to interpretation.\n\nIf I were to take a guess, I'd say the reason behind the downvotes is that people simply don't understand the problem clearly. I think what you really need is one or two examples worked out in detail, perhaps one ending in \"Frustration\" and another ending in a \"Big game\". \n\nBest of luck.",
