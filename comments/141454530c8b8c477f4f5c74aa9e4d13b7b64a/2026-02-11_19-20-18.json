    "content": "While players might get the logic eventually from reading the later tests, I think many players would get frustrated with trying to find the actual formula and drop the clash altogether. For example, having a different output (other than 100%) only from Test 6 onwards seems quite mean; not sure how much information players will be able to gain from those tests. Also, the max function would seem viable until Test 11, then min(a + b, 100) would be viable until Test 18. Test 20 is probably the first clearest example of which formula to apply.\n\nMay I suggest re-ordering the tests in such a way that the \"clearer\" examples (e.g. Test/Validator 20, 21, 24, 25) appear earlier? They need not be the first few examples, but they will help players get to the formula slightly faster, and make the clash slightly more playable.",

I really thought having more tests was the opposite of mean, and I chose the order specifically to not be mean!\n\nWhen we run the tests in the IDE, they run until the first test that doesn't pass, so it seems to me that if someone has a formula that works on most tests but not all, it's better if the tests that pass are first. Otherwise, if the formula fails early, they might think the formula is completely wrong, whereas in reality it still covers a relatively high percentage of tests.\n\n(Remember, the ranking depends on how many tests you've covered correctly: 100% is better than 80%, which is better than 75%, which is better than 50%, etc)",

In fact, the 1% difference obscures the underlying multiplication; the actual difference from the expected sum is 0.64% and 0.99% respectively. Which is why I had to rely on Test 20 to figure that part out.\n\nFor me, I'm not fully satisfied with figuring out a partial formula or trying to score on as many tests as possible by returning the most common result (in this case, 100%). But I get what you mean by allowing players to score as best as possible and give them the feeling of making progress. I guess it just depends on play style.",
