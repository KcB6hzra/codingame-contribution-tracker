    "content": "LVdA  on #generalFR says that there is an issue with the stub generator. Indeed, only n (instead of 5*n) lines are read in order to retrieve the grids.\n\nIn my opinion, this is minor since this puzzle is a community puzzle (and not a clash).\nMoreover, the best solution I see would be to put five copies of Line 2, so that the last read actually do the read for the last input line. But this is far from satisfactory. :(",
