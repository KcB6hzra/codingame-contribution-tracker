    "content": "I just got this in Shortest mode and won with 33% because no one could solve the problem + the complex text manipulation in 15 minutes.\n\nI see in another comment you made the output so complex to make shortest mode harder, but you've made it way too hard (and frustrating) to be a fun clash.\n\nThe core problem is a good clash, but the unnecessary text manipulation takes up most of your time in the clash and unfortunately it's very hard to debug because the output is so long that you can't see the part that differs from the \"Expected\" output in the debugger. I got stuck and couldn't fix beyond the first two tests.",
