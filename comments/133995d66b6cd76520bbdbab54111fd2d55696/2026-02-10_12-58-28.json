    "content": "Just tested your clash, and I think it's quite interesting! Here are some comments I have:\n\n- For absolute clarity, please define a word as a consecutive sequence of letters, and a sentence as a sequence of words separated by spaces.\n\n- I think it is safe to remove rule 2, since you make no reference to \"marks\" anywhere else in the problem statement. Your phrase \"X is the number of correct sentences\" seems to convey your intention well enough.\nEither that, or rephrase rule 2 as \"Each sentence that follows the rule is deemed correct.\"\n\n- Please specify the output of corrected sentences to appear in the order given in the input; e.g., \"<<Next lines>>: The corrected version of all wrong sentences (if any), each on its own line, in the order given in the input.\"\n\n- Please rephrase the second constraint to: \"Each sentence contains only letters and spaces, except for the last character, which will either be {{.}} or {{?}}.\n\n- Please include at least one test case where N > 1 (ideally for a larger N) and all sentences are correct. Similarly, include another test case where N > 1 and all sentences are wrong. Mix the statements and questions for each case.\n\n- Consider randomising the casing of the first word of each sentence (or for all words if you choose). You currently utilise both lowercase and sentence case; I would think that uppercase refers to sentences such as \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\".\nYou can also play around with other cases such as camelCase, PascalCase, tOGGLE cASE, sPoNgEcAsE, etc.",

Split the sentence with the space character as the delimiter.\n2. Change the first word to lowercase and check whether it is one of the question words.\n3. If correct, increase the score.\n4. If not correct, correct the punctuation.\n\nIf you don't want to split the sentence into words, and you just want to check the first few number of characters to see if any question word is the first word, it's slightly more cumbersome, but such an approach still works with the new cases suggested.\n\nEven if the new cases (Test/Validator 5/6) are added, the above approach won't change. I don't see how the complexity increases or the time required to solve the problem will increase significantly.\n\nHope this clarifies.",
