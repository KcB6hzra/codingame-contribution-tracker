Thank you!\n\nMy concern for Shortest was the difficulty of getting it short within 15 minutes - I based it off of asking myself, \"If I got this in a clash, would I enjoy doing it?\" and I think I concluded no after thinking about how heavily I had to debug the solution I wrote under normal circumstances.\n\nBut I guess if more people think it is okay, I can add it in as well.",
