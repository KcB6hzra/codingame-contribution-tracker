    "content": "\"Chings will rule the world\" was a blatantly racist title. I changed it to \"Chards will rule the world\", but I still think this whole submission is overtly political and trying to exaggerate birth rates between China and the West, while using offensive rhetoric.\n\nAs for the clash, it would be better to have some test cases that deal with the case for equality. Validators 2, 3 and 4 all fail if you forget that \"overrule\" means chard population is > aaron population, not >=.\nNo test cases deal with this, so you can get 100% on the tests and then only 50% on the validators if you don't think ahead about this. Would be good to swap one of those validators with a test case.\nMaybe also make it a bit more clear that the aarons \"add [[ar]] more aarons\" rather than \"reproduce to [[ar]] more aarons\" which sounds ambiguous.",
