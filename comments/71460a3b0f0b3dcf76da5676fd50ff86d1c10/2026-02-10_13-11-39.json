An angle made on the clock should not be greater than 360°.\n\n* It does not make sense for both Test 2 and Validator 2 to have the same output. In fact, the angles should be 68 (not 70 nor 85) and 90. Similar argument applies to Test 3 and Validator 3. Would you please rewrite *all* the cases and use accurate angles as input? (The only acceptable rounding should be to the nearest degree, and nothing further than that.)\n\nThanks.",
