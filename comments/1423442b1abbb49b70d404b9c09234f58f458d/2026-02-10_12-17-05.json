    "content": "Major issues\n* Most items stack to 64, but not everything. Your original statement is misleading.\n* The statement addresses the reader directly. The contribution guidelines advise against this style.\n* The statement is unformatted. Please study the formatting syntax on this page: https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/statement .\n* There are several typos and signs of careless writing that reduce clarity.\n* Examples shouldn't appear in the Goal section unless explanation is included.\n* No constraints are specified.\n\nPlease rewrite the various sections as follows:\n\nGoal\nIn Minecraft, most items stack in groups of 64.\n\nGiven the total number of items [[N]], represent it as a sequence of stacks on a single line. Each full stack contains 64 items, and any remainder forms a final stack on the right.\n\nStacks are separated by the character {{|}}, and the output must begin and end with a {{|}} too.\n\nInput\n<<Line 1>>: An integer [[N]] for the total number of items.\n\nOutput\n<<Line 1>>: The stacked representation of [[N]].\n\nConstraints\n1 ≤ [[N]] ≤ 2^14\n\nStub generator\n* Please remove Line 5. The purpose of a \"write\" statement is not to include the author's (your) information.\n\nCases\n* The name for Validator 2 is missing.\n\n* Test 2 and Validator 2 currently use identical inputs; they should differ.\n\n* Each test and its validator should cover the same scenario with slightly different inputs, except for edge cases. Please revise the cases as follows:\n\n  • Test 1 and Validator 1: Edge case, both use 64\n\n  • Test 2 and Validator 2: Small multiples of 64 (e.g. 128 and 192)\n\n  • Test 3 and Validator 3: Small values greater than 64 but not multiples of 64\n\n  • Test 4 and Validator 4: Value smaller than 64\n\n  • Test 5 and Validator 5: Bigger multiples of 64\n\n  • Test 6 and Validator 6: Bigger values which aren't multiples of 64\n\nThanks.",

    "content": "Thanks for the revision. The statement is clearer overall, but a few issues still need attention:\n\nGoal\n* The structure line\n  \"--- |64|64|64(for full stacks)...|(uncompleted piece if it is nonzero)|\"\n  \n  is unclear. It mixes explanation with the example, and the leading \"---\" may make one think it's part of the output format. The output format is also underspecified.\n\n* Please provide a clear explanation of the rules first, and only then show the general structure.\n\n* That is, remove the following section:\n\n\"here is the structure:\n--- |64|64|64(for full stacks)...|(uncompleted piece if it is nonzero)|\"\n\n* And remove all examples (N = 120, 128, 511).\n\n* After that, add the following clarification at the end:\n\n• The stacks are displayed on a single line. \n\n• Each full stack contains 64 items, and any non-zero remainder forms a final stack on the right.\n\n• Stacks are separated by {{|}}, and the output must begin and end with {{|}}.\n\nThe general structure is:\n{{|64|64|64}}…{{|}}[[remainder]]{{|}}\n\nInput\n* Please format [[N]] as a variable.\n\n* Please provide a description of what N represents (see the example wording in my previous comment).\n\nCases\n* Many stacks (Test 3): Please choose another value of N so that the final stack is between 1 and 9, similar to Validator 3.\n\n* Please add a new pair of cases where N = 64 (edge case).\n\n* Please add a new pair of cases where N is a bigger multiple of 64.\n\nThanks.",
