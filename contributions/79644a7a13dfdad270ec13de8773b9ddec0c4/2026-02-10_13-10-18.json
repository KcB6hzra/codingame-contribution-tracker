      "statement": "War (also known as Battle in the UK) is a simple card game, typically played by two players using a standard playing card deck.\n\nOn each turn, each player reveals the top card of their deck (this is a <<\"battle\">>), and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a <<war>>.\n\nAvailable cards are: {{2}}, {{3}}, {{4}}, {{5}}, {{6}}, {{7}}, {{8}}, {{9}}, {{10}}, {{Jack}}, {{Queen}}, {{King}}, {{Ace}}. The value of each number card is the same as its rank, while the value of {{Jack}}, {{Queen}}, {{King}}, {{Ace}} are {{11}}, {{12}}, {{13}} and {{14}} respectively.\n\nThe value of victories varies; triumphing with a <<2>> against an <<Ace>> isn't impressive, whereas winning with a <<King>> against an <<Ace>> is much more compelling.\nYour objective is to determine which player emerges victorious in the battle and evaluate the quality of the win.\n\nQuality of the win is determined by the <<difference between the values of the cards on the table>>:\n- {{1}}-{{3}}: Really Good\n- {{4}}-{{6}}: Good\n- {{7}}-{{9}}: Bad\n- {{10}}-{{12}}: Really Bad\n\nIf the distance is {{0}}, then it's a War",
