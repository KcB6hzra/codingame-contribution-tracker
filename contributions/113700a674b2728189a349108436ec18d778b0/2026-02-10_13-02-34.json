      "statement": "Roll up your sleeves, it's time for a murder mystery! As head detective, you will find a series of clues leading to exactly one [[culprit]]. An elementary clue is a string like {{Madame Turquoise}}, the {{candlestick}}, or the {{reading room}}. These are grouped together as [[evidence]], for instance in the following three sets:\n\n<<1.>> {{Madame Turquoise}}, {{Reverend Crimson}}\n<<2.>> {{candlestick}}, {{noose}}, {{sword}}\n<<3.>> {{reading room}}, {{bedchamber}}\n\nWithin each line, <<one and only one>> of the identified individuals or items was involved in the criminal act. The first set of evidence thus indicates that either {{Madame Turquoise}} or {{Reverend Crimson}} is guilty. As presented for illustration, sets 2 and 3 in this case state the possibilities for weapon and location.\n\nYour task is to determine which of the names <<within the first set>> is the culpable party.\n\n<<Example>>\n\nSuppose that there are six lines of evidence, including the three above. This means that either {{Madame Turquoise}} or {{Reverend Crimson}} is the murderer. We also know their foul play involved one of three weapons and took place in either the {{reading room}} or {{bedchamber}}. A further piece of evidence is:\n\n<<4.>> {{Reverend Crimson}}, {{candlestick}}, {{reading room}}\n\nIn each set, one of the clues is correct, and the others are not. For instance, if {{Reverend Crimson}} is the correct person, then he did not use the {{candlestick}}, nor did he kill the victim in the {{reading room}}. On the other hand, if the {{candlestick}} is the correct weapon, then it was not {{Reverend Crimson}} who vilely swung it.\n\n<<5.>> {{Madame Turquoise}}, {{noose}}, {{reading room}}\n\nNow we put on our deductive hats. If the homicide happened in the {{reading room}}, then neither {{Reverend Crimson}} nor {{Madame Turquoise}} could have been involved, according to the evidence in sets 4 and 5. But this is contradictory, since we already know one of them to be culpable from set 1. Hence, the {{reading room}} cannot be the correct place.\n\n<<6.>> {{Reverend Crimson}}, {{sword}}, {{bedchamber}}\n\nWe can already deduce from set 3 that the crime occurred in the {{bedchamber}}. Finally, this last line of evidence marks {{Reverend Crimson}} as innocent, since only one of the three clues in set 6 can be correct. Therefore, the murder must have been committed by {{Madame Turquoise}} with the {{candlestick}} in the {{bedchamber}}. Another mystery splendidly solved!",

As head detective, you will find a series of clues leading to exactly one <var>culprit</var>. An elementary clue is a string like <const>Madame Turquoise</const>, the <const>candlestick</const>, or the <const>reading room</const>. These are grouped together as <var>evidence</var>, for instance in the following three sets:<br><br><strong>1.</strong> <const>Madame Turquoise</const>, <const>Reverend Crimson</const><br><strong>2.</strong> <const>candlestick</const>, <const>noose</const>, <const>sword</const><br><strong>3.</strong> <const>reading room</const>, <const>bedchamber</const><br><br>Within each line, <strong>one and only one</strong> of the identified individuals or items was involved in the criminal act. The first set of evidence thus indicates that either <const>Madame Turquoise</const> or <const>Reverend Crimson</const> is guilty. As presented for illustration, sets 2 and 3 in this case state the possibilities for weapon and location.<br><br>Your task is to determine which of the names <strong>within the first set</strong> is the culpable party.<br><br><strong>Example</strong><br><br>Suppose that there are six lines of evidence, including the three above. This means that either <const>Madame Turquoise</const> or <const>Reverend Crimson</const> is the murderer. We also know their foul play involved one of three weapons and took place in either the <const>reading room</const> or <const>bedchamber</const>. A further piece of evidence is:<br><br><strong>4.</strong> <const>Reverend Crimson</const>, <const>candlestick</const>, <const>reading room</const><br><br>In each set, one of the clues is correct, and the others are not. For instance, if <const>Reverend Crimson</const> is the correct person, then he did not use the <const>candlestick</const>, nor did he kill the victim in the <const>reading room</const>. On the other hand, if the <const>candlestick</const> is the correct weapon, then it was not <const>Reverend Crimson</const> who vilely swung it.<br><br><strong>5.</strong> <const>Madame Turquoise</const>, <const>noose</const>, <const>reading room</const><br><br>Now we put on our deductive hats. If the homicide happened in the <const>reading room</const>, then neither <const>Reverend Crimson</const> nor <const>Madame Turquoise</const> could have been involved, according to the evidence in sets 4 and 5. But this is contradictory, since we already know one of them to be culpable from set 1. Hence, the <const>reading room</const> cannot be the correct place.<br><br><strong>6.</strong> <const>Reverend Crimson</const>, <const>sword</const>, <const>bedchamber</const><br><br>We can already deduce from set 3 that the crime occurred in the <const>bedchamber</const>. Finally, this last line of evidence marks <const>Reverend Crimson</const> as innocent, since only one of the three clues in set 6 can be correct. Therefore, the murder must have been committed by <const>Madame Turquoise</const> with the <const>candlestick</const> in the <const>bedchamber</const>. Another mystery splendidly solved!</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"statement-section statement-protocol\">\n   <div class=\"blk\">\n      <div class=\"title\">Input</div>\n      <div class=\"question-statement-input\"><strong>Line 1:</strong> Two space-separated integers <var>L</var> for lines of evidence and <var>N</var> for number of suspects<br><strong>Next <var>L</var> lines:</strong> A string <var>evidence</var> in the form of a set of elementary clues, comma-space separated<br><br>The first line of evidence consists of <var>N</var> clues listing every suspect.</div>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"blk\">\n      <div class=\"title\">Output</div>\n      <div class=\"question-statement-output\"><strong>Line 1:</strong> The identified <var>culprit</var> from the first line of evidence</div>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"blk\">\n      <div class=\"title\">Constraints</div>\n      <div class=\"question-statement-constraints\">1 &le; <var>L</var> &le; 250<br><var>N</var> &lt; 12<br>The number of unique clues is less than 1250.<br>The problem constraints are satisfied by exactly one <var>culprit</var>.</div>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"blk\">\n      <div class=\"title\">Example</div>\n      <div class=\"statement-inout\">\n         <div class=\"statement-inout-in\">\n            <div class=\"title\">Input</div>\n            <pre class=\"question-statement-example-in\">6 2\nMadame Turquoise, Reverend Crimson\ncandlestick, noose, sword\nreading room, bedchamber\nReverend Crimson, candlestick, reading room\nMadame Turquoise, noose, reading room\nReverend Crimson, sword, bedchamber</pre>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"statement-inout-out\">\n            <div class=\"title\">Output</div>\n            <pre class=\"question-statement-example-out\">Madame Turquoise</pre>\n         </div>\n      </div>\n   </div>\n</div>"
