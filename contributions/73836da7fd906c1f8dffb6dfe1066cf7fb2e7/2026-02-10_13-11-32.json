      "statement": "Tom and Jerry have a course of 10 iterations. Tom starts ahead of Jerry at the beginning of the race. You are given Tom's starting position [[tomStart]], while Jerry always begins at position 0. You are also given the speeds of both Tom and Jerry [[tomSpeed]] and [[jerrySpeed]]. You need to display each runner on the screen at the start and at the finish. Tom is represented by {{T}}, and Jerry by {{J}}. Finally, you need to determine the winner. If Tom wins, print {{Tom wins}}; otherwise, print {{Jerry wins}}. Jerry can only win if he is actually ahead of Tom. Distances on the course are filled with the space character; the leftmost character is at position 0, and the position increases to the right, 1 position per character.\nFor example, if Jerry starts at position 0 with a speed of 1, we have to represent him as mentioned: {{J}} follows by 10 spaces follows by {{J}}. Why do we print 10 spaces between the two {{J}}? Because After the race, Jerry was in position 10, and then he moved to position 11 to make room for the referee to measure the distance.",
