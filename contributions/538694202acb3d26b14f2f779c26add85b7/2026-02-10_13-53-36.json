Your goal is to determine which life expectancies are the best suited to reach Sky's Edge with at least 200 settlers, while avoiding overcrowding the ship.>>\n\nThe journey will last [[Y]] years, with a variable starting group of people, on a starship having a maximum capacity of [[C]]. Every member of the expedition will have exactly the same life expectancy. \n\nEvery year, these modifications will take place in the given order :\n1 - Every crew member will get older by one year.\n2 - Every crew member exceeding the life expectancy will die.\n3 - For each batch of {{10}} crew members between the age of {{20}} and half the life expectancy (rounded down), a baby is born, adding one 0-year-old individual to the crew. These limits are inclusive.\n\nIf the number of people exceeds the ship capacity {{C}}, overpopulation causes a civil war leading to the destruction of the ship. The expedition is considered successful if at least {{200}} people reach Sky's Edge after [[Y]] years of travel.\n\nYour goal is to give the minimum and maximum life expectancies in order to have a successful expedition. There is always at least one valid life expectancy. \n\n<<Example :>>\nThe ship has 10 fifteen-year-olds, 15 twenty-year-olds, 5 forty-year-olds and 2 eighty-year-olds. The life expectancy is of 82 years.\n- At year 1, there will be 10 sixteen-year-olds, 15 twenty-one-year-olds, 5  forty-one-year-olds, 2 eighty-one-year-olds AND 2 zero-year-olds, since the 15 twenty-one-year-olds and 5 forty-one-year-olds are within the \"fertility span\" of [20, 41].\n- At year 2,  there will be 2 one-year-olds, 10 seventeen-year-olds, 15 twenty-two-year-olds, 5  forty-two-year-olds, 2 eighty-two-year-olds and only one new zero-year-old.\n- At year 3, there will be 1 one-year-old, 2 two-year-olds, 10 eighteen-year-olds, 15 twenty-three-year-olds, 5  forty-three-year-olds and one zero-year-old.
