Both squads appear evenly matched, and there has been a stalemate for hours. There is a mortar kit which includes a rudimentary range finder, but unfortunately for your squad, no one knows how to operate it properly; however, at this point, attempting to use it is becoming your only viable option.

Good, you will need those to do your calculations. Your range finder is going to provide you with a horizontal distance between you and the enemy unit. The stereoscope will need to be focused for an accurate reading. I recommend that you don't get spotted using it just yet. You will then need to use that [[range]] and also the {{exit velocity}} of your mortar round to determine what angle you will need to use to successfully land your shot. I will send you the info for the M2 mortar and the physics behind it right away, but when you start firing, I want you to radio me the <<angle>> and <<flight time>> so that I know that your calculations are at least somewhat accurate.
