You can buy potatoes for all money that you have on your account and sell all potatoes back later starting from next tick. Only one buy-sell operation is allowed per day. If you buy potatoes you must sell them later. If price is not a divisor of amount of money that you have than you receive fractional number (balance / price) of potatoes.\n3. If you don't want to trade today you can skip and amount of money on your account will not change.\n\nYou know initial amount of money on your account and have a list of potatoes price ticks during the day. You need to find maximum amount of money that is possible to have your account by the end of the day.",
