      "statement": "A syllogism (Greek: συλλογισμός syllogismos, \"conclusion, inference\") is a kind of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two (in this case) or more propositions (ie premises) that are asserted or assumed to be true. Here is a typical syllogism:\n\nall men are mortal\nall Greeks are men\ntherefore, all Greeks are mortal\n\nIn this puzzle you will deal only with categorical syllogisms. \n\nA valid syllogism is one whose conclusion logically follows from its premises. A syllogism can be valid but not sound (ie does not make sense to people) as in :\n\nSome bears are venusians.\nAll venusians are arachnids.\nTherefore some arachnids are bears.\n\nYour goal is to:\n1 - Read a syllogism\n3 - Parse it\n3 - Evaluate it \n\nIdentifying the type of the premises and conclusions and the relation between the various [[subjects]] and [[predicates]] will let you decide wether the syllogism is {{VALID}} or {{INVALID}}.\n\nAll provided syllogism are syntaxically correct (ie the {{and}} and {{therefore}} keywords are well placed, the {{not}} keyword will not appear with a {{all}} or {{no}} keyword, etc ...)\n\n\nEach syllogysm is structured as follows:\n[[majorPremise]] {{and}} [[minorPremise]] {{therefore}} [[conclusion]]\n\n[[majorPremise]], [[minorPremise]] and [[conclusion]] are structured as follow:\n{{all|no|some}} [[subject]] [[verb]] [{{not}}] [[predicate]]\n\n[[subject]] and [[predicate]] are single different words on a given premise/conclusion. You do not have to care for singular or plural : matching terms will always be provided with the same form. Also as a hint, the [[verb]] does not have any importance in this exercise, only the opening word ({{all}}, {{no}}, {{some}}), [[subject]] and [[predicate]] and when applicable the {{not}}. \n\nThe {{not}} keyword may only appear with a {{some}} keyword (ie : \"some boat have sails\", \"some apples are not green\")\n\nThe {{and}} and {{therefore}} keywords (surrounded by spaces) will not appear in the premises.",
