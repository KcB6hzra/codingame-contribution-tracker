      "statement": "Marc is passionate about table tennis... but he often gets distracted when watching a match. He needs a tool that lets him tell who's leading the current set and who's going to serve on the next shot... or if the set is over.\n\nIn table tennis, the serve alternates between players every <<two points>>. So, the first player serves twice (regardless of the score), then their opponent serves twice, and so on. The first player to <<11 points>> wins the set.\nBe careful! If the players reach a score of 10-10, the serve alternates <<every point>>, and the winner is the first to be <<two points ahead>> of their opponent.\n\nRegarding scoring, the score of the player <<who will serve next>> is always announced <<in front>>. If the set has already ended, this still applies: the first score announced is the score of the player who would serve next if the game were to continue.\nFor example, when Player A is about to serve and the score is 5-3, he is the one leading.",
