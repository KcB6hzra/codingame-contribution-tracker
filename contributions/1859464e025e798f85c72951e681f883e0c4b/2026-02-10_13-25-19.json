Unfortunately, you cannot do this without the help of coding. Assuming that the answers given on the survey are a 100% correct, you are to create a program that takes the survey answers and predicts the genres of each person given their age and their gender.\n\nFor example, \"males aged 20-27 like rock\" means that a male that is 23 years old would like rock. Similarly, \"females aged 20-27 like hip hop\" means that a 23-year-old female would like hip hop.\n\nSurvey answers are the ones that have an age, gender and a genre. the data you need to predict the genres for have an age and a gender only.\n\nIf you can't specify what genre they like (e.g. the given age/gender is not included in the survey answers), simply print {{None}}.",
