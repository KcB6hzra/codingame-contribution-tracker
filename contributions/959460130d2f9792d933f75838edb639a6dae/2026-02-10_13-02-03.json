      "statement": "This puzzle is part 3 of a multi-part Algorithm X tutorial and is meant to be done per the guidance in the following playground:\n\n{{https://www.algorithm-x.com}}\n\nYou are free to solve this puzzle in any language you choose. While the playground demonstrations are written in Python, a reusable Algorithm X Solver is available in many different languages. By following the guidance in the playground and using the solver as intended, this puzzle should be much easier than attempting it from scratch.\n\n<<Task Overview:>>\n\nMrs. Knuth has received some wonderful news! This summer, she will only be working with a handful of honor students. Although she'll have fewer students, each student is now allowed to request multiple hours of instruction per week. This creates a situation where many potential schedules exist. Based on her preferences, Mrs. Knuth needs you to find the <<best>> schedule possible.\n\n<<Schedule Score Calculation:>>\n\nThe school math teacher, Mrs. Ruth, worked with Mrs. Knuth to develop the following scoring system to compare one schedule option to another. (High scores are better than low scores.)\n\n<<Free Time:>> Continuous free time is more valuable than broken up chunks of free time. Any single hour of free time, including LUNCH, gets 2 points. However, 2 or more continuous hours of free time gets points calculated as 2 ^ ([[numberContinuousFreeHours]]). e.g. 5 continuous free hours gets 2 ^ 5 = 32 points. On the other hand, if Mrs. Knuth had lessons on some particular day at 9, 11, 1 and 3, she would still have 5 free hours during the day, but since each of those free hours would be standalone hours, the [[continuousFreeTimeScore]] for that day would be only 10 (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2).\n\n<<Loud Instruments:>> Mrs. Knuth prefers to teach [[loudInstrument]]s during the morning hours whenever possible. Loud instruments taught during morning hours ({{8}}, {{9}}, {{10}} or {{11}}) get 50 points. Loud instruments taught in the afternoon get zero points.\n\n<<Scheduling:>> Mrs. Knuth's energy wanes as the week progresses. She prefers having lesson early in the week as compared to late in the week. She also prefers teaching in the morning whenever possible.\n\nEvery student must be put on the schedule a number of times equal to that student's [[numHoursRequested]]. Each student placement on the schedule gets points determined by the day of the week and whether the placement was in the morning or the afternoon. Points for morning lessons (in order from Monday to Friday) are {{15}}, {{12}}, {{9}}, {{6}} and {{3}}. Lessons scheduled in the afternoon receive {{10}}, {{8}}, {{6}}, {{4}} or {{2}} points depending on the day of the week.\n\n<<Alphabetical Order:>> Mrs. Knuth's oddities are well known, so it should not be a shock that she prefers her daily students to be in alphabetical order. Consider each day of the week independently. Create a list of students from the beginning of the day to the end of the day, ignoring all free time. For each pair of contiguous students, if those students are in ascending alphabetical order, 15 points are awarded. A day that has only one lesson receives 0 points since there are no two student names to compare. A full day, with 8 students, could have up to 7 * 15 = 105 points.\n\nMrs. Ruth has been a tremendous help to Mrs. Knuth, but creating a scoring system to determine a best score might be an evolving process. Because of that, Mrs. Knuth has made one last request. After you display the best schedule, she would like you to \"show your work\" in regards to your calculations. This will help her see how her scoring system works which might help her make future improvements.\n\nAfter displaying the best [[schedule]], you must display 4 [[calculationDetailString]]s (one for <<each category>> above) and, finally, the [[bestScheduleScore]]. A [[calculationDetailString]] must be in the following format:\n\n[[mondayScore]]{{+}}[[tuesdayScore]]{{+}}[[wednesdayScore]]{{+}}[[thursdayScore]]{{+}}[[fridayScore]]{{=}}[[weeklyScore]]\n\nThe [[bestScheduleScore]] is the sum of its four [[weeklyScore]]s.\n\nAll of Mrs. Knuth's previous requests must still be honored:\n\n• No single [[instrument]] shall be taught more than one hour per day.\n\n• No two [[loudInstrument]]s shall be scheduled in back-to-back hours.\n\n• [[troublesomePair]]s shall not be scheduled back-to-back.\n\nAll notes about INPUT and OUTPUT formatting still apply to Part III.

While the playground demonstrations are written in Python, a reusable Algorithm X Solver is available in many different languages. By following the guidance in the playground and using the solver as intended, this puzzle should be much easier than attempting it from scratch.<br><br><strong>Task Overview:</strong><br><br>Mrs. Knuth has received some wonderful news! This summer, she will only be working with a handful of honor students. Although she'll have fewer students, each student is now allowed to request multiple hours of instruction per week. This creates a situation where many potential schedules exist. Based on her preferences, Mrs. Knuth needs you to find the <strong>best</strong> schedule possible.<br><br><strong>Schedule Score Calculation:</strong><br><br>The school math teacher, Mrs. Ruth, worked with Mrs. Knuth to develop the following scoring system to compare one schedule option to another. (High scores are better than low scores.)<br><br><strong>Free Time:</strong> Continuous free time is more valuable than broken up chunks of free time. Any single hour of free time, including LUNCH, gets 2 points. However, 2 or more continuous hours of free time gets points calculated as 2 ^ (<var>numberContinuousFreeHours</var>). e.g. 5 continuous free hours gets 2 ^ 5 = 32 points. On the other hand, if Mrs. Knuth had lessons on some particular day at 9, 11, 1 and 3, she would still have 5 free hours during the day, but since each of those free hours would be standalone hours, the <var>continuousFreeTimeScore</var> for that day would be only 10 (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2).<br><br><strong>Loud Instruments:</strong> Mrs. Knuth prefers to teach <var>loudInstrument</var>s during the morning hours whenever possible. Loud instruments taught during morning hours (<const>8</const>, <const>9</const>, <const>10</const> or <const>11</const>) get 50 points. Loud instruments taught in the afternoon get zero points.<br><br><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Mrs. Knuth's energy wanes as the week progresses. She prefers having lesson early in the week as compared to late in the week. She also prefers teaching in the morning whenever possible.<br><br>Every student must be put on the schedule a number of times equal to that student's <var>numHoursRequested</var>. Each student placement on the schedule gets points determined by the day of the week and whether the placement was in the morning or the afternoon. Points for morning lessons (in order from Monday to Friday) are <const>15</const>, <const>12</const>, <const>9</const>, <const>6</const> and <const>3</const>. Lessons scheduled in the afternoon receive <const>10</const>, <const>8</const>, <const>6</const>, <const>4</const> or <const>2</const> points depending on the day of the week.<br><br><strong>Alphabetical Order:</strong> Mrs. Knuth's oddities are well known, so it should not be a shock that she prefers her daily students to be in alphabetical order. Consider each day of the week independently. Create a list of students from the beginning of the day to the end of the day, ignoring all free time. For each pair of contiguous students, if those students are in ascending alphabetical order, 15 points are awarded. A day that has only one lesson receives 0 points since there are no two student names to compare. A full day, with 8 students, could have up to 7 * 15 = 105 points.<br><br>Mrs. Ruth has been a tremendous help to Mrs. Knuth, but creating a scoring system to determine a best score might be an evolving process. Because of that, Mrs. Knuth has made one last request. After you display the best schedule, she would like you to &quot;show your work&quot; in regards to your calculations. This will help her see how her scoring system works which might help her make future improvements.<br><br>After displaying the best <var>schedule</var>, you must display 4 <var>calculationDetailString</var>s (one for <strong>each category</strong> above) and, finally, the <var>bestScheduleScore</var>. A <var>calculationDetailString</var> must be in the following format:<br><br><var>mondayScore</var><const>+</const><var>tuesdayScore</var><const>+</const><var>wednesdayScore</var><const>+</const><var>thursdayScore</var><const>+</const><var>fridayScore</var><const>=</const><var>weeklyScore</var><br><br>The <var>bestScheduleScore</var> is the sum of its four <var>weeklyScore</var>s.<br><br>All of Mrs. Knuth's previous requests must still be honored:<br><br>&bull; No single <var>instrument</var> shall be taught more than one hour per day.<br><br>&bull; No two <var>loudInstrument</var>s shall be scheduled in back-to-back hours.<br><br>&bull; <var>troublesomePair</var>s shall not be scheduled back-to-back.<br><br>All notes about INPUT and OUTPUT formatting still apply to Part III.
