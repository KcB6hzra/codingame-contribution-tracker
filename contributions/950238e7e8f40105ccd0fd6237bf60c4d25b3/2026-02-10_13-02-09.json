By following the guidance in the playground and using the solver as intended, this puzzle should be much easier than attempting it from scratch.\n\n<<Task Overview:>>\n\nMrs. Knuth was thrilled with the work you did for her in Part I and her scheduling has been a breeze! She did run into a couple of issues though, and she'd like you to integrate the following changes into your scheduling algorithm.\n\nMrs. Knuth's schedule needs to be more flexible than she first thought. She isn't able to always teach the same number of hours on her teaching days. She also doesn't always have enough students to completely fill her [[teacherAvailability]]. You'll need to adjust your algorithm to handle her [[teacherAvailability]] possibly containing different numbers of hours for each day she teaches and you'll need to be able to handle hours in her [[teacherAvailability]] for which there ends up being no student scheduled.\n\nYou might be impressed with Mrs. Knuth's newfound flexibility, but don't get too relaxed. She still requires that no instrument be taught more than one hour on any one day. On top of that, she has struggled with [[loudInstrument]]s, specifically the {{Trumpet}}, the {{Drums}} and the {{Trombone}}. In the interest of her long-term hearing, she has asked that you make sure no two [[loudInstrument]]s are ever scheduled back-to-back. (A lesson at 11am and a lesson at 1pm are not considered back-to-back since there is an hour lunch break between the two.)\n\nFor the most part, the kids in school are good kids, but some kids get a bit rowdy when they are with certain friends. To avoid disruptions to her schedule, Mrs. Knuth has given you a list of [[troublesomePair]]s. It's important the individuals in these pairs never be scheduled back-to-back. There must be at least an hour of time between the two individuals to ensure they don't get each other wound up and start causing trouble.\n\nDespite Mrs. Knuth's wacky requests, all students must get a spot on her schedule.\n\nAll notes about INPUT and OUTPUT formatting still apply to Part II. For your reference, those notes have been copied here:\n\n<<Note About INPUT Formatting:>>\n\nAvailability for Mrs. Knuth, or for any one student, is formatted as a character string using the following abbreviations for the days of the week: {{M}}, {{Tu}}, {{W}}, {{Th}} and {{F}}. An [[availabilityString]] will contain all 5 abbreviations in this same order. After each abbreviation will be between 0 and 8 integers representing the times the person is available on that day. Lessons can be taught in the morning at {{8}}, {{9}}, {{10}} and {{11}} and in the afternoon at {{1}}, {{2}}, {{3}} and {{4}}. Consider the following [[availabilityString]]:\n\n{{M 1 2 3 Tu W Th 8 9 F 11}}\n\nThis indicates the person is available on {{Monday}} at {{1}}pm, {{2}}pm and {{3}}pm, on {{Thursday}} at {{8}}am and {{9}}am and on {{Friday}} at {{11}}am. This person has no availability on {{Tuesday}} or {{Wednesday}}.\n\nThe only valid elements in an [[availabilityString]] are {{M}}, {{Tu}}, {{W}}, {{Th}}, {{F}}, {{8}}, {{9}}, {{10}}, {{11}}, {{1}}, {{2}}, {{3}} and {{4}}. All elements of an [[availabilityString]] are space separated.\n\n<<Note About OUTPUT Formatting:>>\n\nMrs. Knuth requires a very specific format for her calendar. Her calendar has 10 rows and 6 columns with one space between each of the 6 columns.\n\nColumn 1 is 2 characters wide. In it, rows 2 – 5 and 7 – 10 contain the hours of the days, right justified. See the example below.\n\nColumns 2 – 6 are each 14 characters wide. The contents of each row in each column is always center justified, with the extra space being on the right when it is not possible to perfectly center justify the text. At the top of each column is the day, fully written out as {{Monday}}, {{Tuesday}}, {{Wednesday}}, {{Thursday}} or {{Friday}}. In the 6th row of columns 2 - 6 is the word {{LUNCH}}.\n\nThe remainder of columns 2 – 6 contain Mrs. Knuth’s teaching schedule. If no student is scheduled on a particular day at a particular hour, the schedule should contain 14 dashes ({{--------------}}). Wherever a student has been scheduled, the location should contain the student’s name and the student’s instrument separated by a {{/}}.\n\nAll lines of the schedule must have trailing spaces removed.",

While the playground demonstrations are written in Python, a reusable Algorithm X Solver is available in many different languages. By following the guidance in the playground and using the solver as intended, this puzzle should be much easier than attempting it from scratch.<br><br><strong>Task Overview:</strong><br><br>Mrs. Knuth was thrilled with the work you did for her in Part I and her scheduling has been a breeze! She did run into a couple of issues though, and she'd like you to integrate the following changes into your scheduling algorithm.<br><br>Mrs. Knuth's schedule needs to be more flexible than she first thought. She isn't able to always teach the same number of hours on her teaching days. She also doesn't always have enough students to completely fill her <var>teacherAvailability</var>. You'll need to adjust your algorithm to handle her <var>teacherAvailability</var> possibly containing different numbers of hours for each day she teaches and you'll need to be able to handle hours in her <var>teacherAvailability</var> for which there ends up being no student scheduled.<br><br>You might be impressed with Mrs. Knuth's newfound flexibility, but don't get too relaxed. She still requires that no instrument be taught more than one hour on any one day. On top of that, she has struggled with <var>loudInstrument</var>s, specifically the <const>Trumpet</const>, the <const>Drums</const> and the <const>Trombone</const>. In the interest of her long-term hearing, she has asked that you make sure no two <var>loudInstrument</var>s are ever scheduled back-to-back. (A lesson at 11am and a lesson at 1pm are not considered back-to-back since there is an hour lunch break between the two.)<br><br>For the most part, the kids in school are good kids, but some kids get a bit rowdy when they are with certain friends. To avoid disruptions to her schedule, Mrs. Knuth has given you a list of <var>troublesomePair</var>s. It's important the individuals in these pairs never be scheduled back-to-back. There must be at least an hour of time between the two individuals to ensure they don't get each other wound up and start causing trouble.<br><br>Despite Mrs. Knuth's wacky requests, all students must get a spot on her schedule.<br><br>All notes about INPUT and OUTPUT formatting still apply to Part II. For your reference, those notes have been copied here:<br><br><strong>Note About INPUT Formatting:</strong><br><br>Availability for Mrs. Knuth, or for any one student, is formatted as a character string using the following abbreviations for the days of the week: <const>M</const>, <const>Tu</const>, <const>W</const>, <const>Th</const> and <const>F</const>. An <var>availabilityString</var> will contain all 5 abbreviations in this same order. After each abbreviation will be between 0 and 8 integers representing the times the person is available on that day. Lessons can be taught in the morning at <const>8</const>, <const>9</const>, <const>10</const> and <const>11</const> and in the afternoon at <const>1</const>, <const>2</const>, <const>3</const> and <const>4</const>. Consider the following <var>availabilityString</var>:<br><br><const>M 1 2 3 Tu W Th 8 9 F 11</const><br><br>This indicates the person is available on <const>Monday</const> at <const>1</const>pm, <const>2</const>pm and <const>3</const>pm, on <const>Thursday</const> at <const>8</const>am and <const>9</const>am and on <const>Friday</const> at <const>11</const>am. This person has no availability on <const>Tuesday</const> or <const>Wednesday</const>.<br><br>The only valid elements in an <var>availabilityString</var> are <const>M</const>, <const>Tu</const>, <const>W</const>, <const>Th</const>, <const>F</const>, <const>8</const>, <const>9</const>, <const>10</const>, <const>11</const>, <const>1</const>, <const>2</const>, <const>3</const> and <const>4</const>. All elements of an <var>availabilityString</var> are space separated.<br><br><strong>Note About OUTPUT Formatting:</strong><br><br>Mrs. Knuth requires a very specific format for her calendar. Her calendar has 10 rows and 6 columns with one space between each of the 6 columns.<br><br>Column 1 is 2 characters wide. In it, rows 2 &ndash; 5 and 7 &ndash; 10 contain the hours of the days, right justified. See the example below.<br><br>Columns 2 &ndash; 6 are each 14 characters wide. The contents of each row in each column is always center justified, with the extra space being on the right when it is not possible to perfectly center justify the text. At the top of each column is the day, fully written out as <const>Monday</const>, <const>Tuesday</const>, <const>Wednesday</const>, <const>Thursday</const> or <const>Friday</const>. In the 6th row of columns 2 - 6 is the word <const>LUNCH</const>.<br><br>The remainder of columns 2 &ndash; 6 contain Mrs. Knuth&rsquo;s teaching schedule. If no student is scheduled on a particular day at a particular hour, the schedule should contain 14 dashes (<const>--------------</const>). Wherever a student has been scheduled, the location should contain the student&rsquo;s name and the student&rsquo;s instrument separated by a <const>/</const>.<br><br>All lines of the schedule must have trailing spaces removed.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"statement-section statement-protocol\">\n   <div class=\"blk\">\n      <div class=\"title\">Input</div>\n      <div class=\"question-statement-input\"><strong>Line 1:</strong> Mrs. Knuth&rsquo;s <var>teacherAvailability</var><br><br><strong>Line 2:</strong> An integer <var>numStudents</var><br><br><strong>Next <var>numStudents</var> lines:</strong> <var>name</var> <var>instrument</var> <var>studentAvailability</var><br><br><strong>Next Line:</strong> An integer <var>numTroublesomePairs</var><br><br><strong>Next <var>numTroublesomePairs</var> lines:</strong> <var>name1</var> <var>name2</var></div>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"blk\">\n      <div class=\"title\">Output</div>\n      <div class=\"question-statement-output\"><strong>10 lines:</strong> <var>schedule</var> per the rules above.
