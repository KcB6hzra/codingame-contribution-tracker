Each day your program receives the measured levels of [[estrogen]] (in pg/ml) and [[LH]] (in mIU/ml). \n\nIf [[LH]] exceeds the threshold of {{50.0 mIU/ml}}, your program should output {{Peak fertility}}. Otherwise, if [[estrogen]] exceeds the threshold of {{100.0 pg/ml}}, your program should output {{High fertility}}. If neither value exceeds the threshold, output {{Low fertility}}. \n\nHowever, if {{Peak fertility}} was displayed once, your program's output to further tests on the following days should be {{Stop testing, peak fertility reached!}}\n\n<<Note: Clash of Code is not medical advice.
