      "statement": "This puzzle is part 1 of a multi-part Algorithm X tutorial and is meant to be done per the guidance in the following playground:\n\n{{https://www.algorithm-x.com}}\n\nYou are free to solve this puzzle in any language you choose. While the playground demonstrations are written in Python, a reusable Algorithm X Solver is available in many different languages. By following the guidance in the playground and using the solver as intended, this puzzle should be much easier than attempting it from scratch.\n\n<<Task Overview:>>\n\nMrs. Knuth, the school band teacher, has asked you to write an algorithm to generate her weekly private lesson schedule for the summer. Her availability is different from week to week, but she will always teach between 1 and 5 days per week. On each day that she teaches, she will teach between 2 and 8 hours. Because she likes consistency, she will teach the same number of hours on each day she teaches, but the actual time slots during which she is available might be different from day to day.\n\nMrs. Knuth is a creature of habit. Her workday starts at 8am every day and ends at 5pm with an hour break for lunch each day from noon to 1pm. Although she is at school 9 total hours every day, she might not be available to teach on some days, she might have partial teaching availability on other days or she might have a day where she teaches every free minute other than during lunch.\n\nMrs. Knuth is also a bit odd when it comes to music. To keep her mind fresh, she refuses to teach more than a single hour per day for any particular instrument. If she teaches 3 hours in one day, those lessons must be for 3 different instruments. If she teaches 8 hours in one day, all 8 instruments that day must be different.\n\nGiven Mrs. Knuth’s open availability and each student’s instrument and lesson availability, generate a schedule for Mrs. Knuth that allows her to work with each student one time per week and meets her quirky demands.\n\n<<Note About INPUT Formatting:>>\n\nAvailability for Mrs. Knuth, or for any one student, is formatted as a character string using the following abbreviations for the days of the week: {{M}}, {{Tu}}, {{W}}, {{Th}} and {{F}}. An [[availabilityString]] will contain all 5 abbreviations in this same order. After each abbreviation will be between 0 and 8 integers representing the times the person is available on that day. Lessons can be taught in the morning at {{8}}, {{9}}, {{10}} and {{11}} and in the afternoon at {{1}}, {{2}}, {{3}} and {{4}}. Consider the following [[availabilityString]]:\n\n{{M 1 2 3 Tu W Th 8 9 F 11}}\n\nThis indicates the person is available on {{Monday}} at {{1}}pm, {{2}}pm and {{3}}pm, on {{Thursday}} at {{8}}am and {{9}}am and on {{Friday}} at {{11}}am. This person has no availability on {{Tuesday}} or {{Wednesday}}.\n\nThe only valid elements in an [[availabilityString]] are {{M}}, {{Tu}}, {{W}}, {{Th}}, {{F}}, {{8}}, {{9}}, {{10}}, {{11}}, {{1}}, {{2}}, {{3}} and {{4}}. All elements of an [[availabilityString]] are space separated.\n\n<<Note About OUTPUT Formatting:>>\n\nMrs. Knuth requires a very specific format for her calendar. Her calendar has 10 rows and 6 columns with one space between each of the 6 columns.\n\nColumn 1 is 2 characters wide. In it, rows 2 – 5 and 7 – 10 contain the hours of the days, right justified. See the example below.\n\nColumns 2 – 6 are each 14 characters wide. The contents of each row in each column is always center justified, with the extra space being on the right when it is not possible to perfectly center justify the text. At the top of each column is the day, fully written out as {{Monday}}, {{Tuesday}}, {{Wednesday}}, {{Thursday}} or {{Friday}}. In the 6th row of columns 2 - 6 is the word {{LUNCH}}.\n\nThe remainder of columns 2 – 6 contain Mrs. Knuth’s teaching schedule. If no student is scheduled on a particular day at a particular hour, the schedule should contain 14 dashes ({{--------------}}). Wherever a student has been scheduled, the location should contain the student’s name and the student’s instrument separated by a {{/}}.\n\nAll lines of the schedule must have trailing spaces removed.",

While the playground demonstrations are written in Python, a reusable Algorithm X Solver is available in many different languages. By following the guidance in the playground and using the solver as intended, this puzzle should be much easier than attempting it from scratch.<br><br><strong>Task Overview:</strong><br><br>Mrs. Knuth, the school band teacher, has asked you to write an algorithm to generate her weekly private lesson schedule for the summer. Her availability is different from week to week, but she will always teach between 1 and 5 days per week. On each day that she teaches, she will teach between 2 and 8 hours. Because she likes consistency, she will teach the same number of hours on each day she teaches, but the actual time slots during which she is available might be different from day to day.<br><br>Mrs. Knuth is a creature of habit. Her workday starts at 8am every day and ends at 5pm with an hour break for lunch each day from noon to 1pm. Although she is at school 9 total hours every day, she might not be available to teach on some days, she might have partial teaching availability on other days or she might have a day where she teaches every free minute other than during lunch.<br><br>Mrs. Knuth is also a bit odd when it comes to music. To keep her mind fresh, she refuses to teach more than a single hour per day for any particular instrument. If she teaches 3 hours in one day, those lessons must be for 3 different instruments. If she teaches 8 hours in one day, all 8 instruments that day must be different.<br><br>Given Mrs. Knuth&rsquo;s open availability and each student&rsquo;s instrument and lesson availability, generate a schedule for Mrs. Knuth that allows her to work with each student one time per week and meets her quirky demands.<br><br><strong>Note About INPUT Formatting:</strong><br><br>Availability for Mrs. Knuth, or for any one student, is formatted as a character string using the following abbreviations for the days of the week: <const>M</const>, <const>Tu</const>, <const>W</const>, <const>Th</const> and <const>F</const>. An <var>availabilityString</var> will contain all 5 abbreviations in this same order. After each abbreviation will be between 0 and 8 integers representing the times the person is available on that day. Lessons can be taught in the morning at <const>8</const>, <const>9</const>, <const>10</const> and <const>11</const> and in the afternoon at <const>1</const>, <const>2</const>, <const>3</const> and <const>4</const>. Consider the following <var>availabilityString</var>:<br><br><const>M 1 2 3 Tu W Th 8 9 F 11</const><br><br>This indicates the person is available on <const>Monday</const> at <const>1</const>pm, <const>2</const>pm and <const>3</const>pm, on <const>Thursday</const> at <const>8</const>am and <const>9</const>am and on <const>Friday</const> at <const>11</const>am. This person has no availability on <const>Tuesday</const> or <const>Wednesday</const>.<br><br>The only valid elements in an <var>availabilityString</var> are <const>M</const>, <const>Tu</const>, <const>W</const>, <const>Th</const>, <const>F</const>, <const>8</const>, <const>9</const>, <const>10</const>, <const>11</const>, <const>1</const>, <const>2</const>, <const>3</const> and <const>4</const>. All elements of an <var>availabilityString</var> are space separated.<br><br><strong>Note About OUTPUT Formatting:</strong><br><br>Mrs. Knuth requires a very specific format for her calendar. Her calendar has 10 rows and 6 columns with one space between each of the 6 columns.<br><br>Column 1 is 2 characters wide. In it, rows 2 &ndash; 5 and 7 &ndash; 10 contain the hours of the days, right justified. See the example below.<br><br>Columns 2 &ndash; 6 are each 14 characters wide. The contents of each row in each column is always center justified, with the extra space being on the right when it is not possible to perfectly center justify the text. At the top of each column is the day, fully written out as <const>Monday</const>, <const>Tuesday</const>, <const>Wednesday</const>, <const>Thursday</const> or <const>Friday</const>. In the 6th row of columns 2 - 6 is the word <const>LUNCH</const>.<br><br>The remainder of columns 2 &ndash; 6 contain Mrs. Knuth&rsquo;s teaching schedule. If no student is scheduled on a particular day at a particular hour, the schedule should contain 14 dashes (<const>--------------</const>). Wherever a student has been scheduled, the location should contain the student&rsquo;s name and the student&rsquo;s instrument separated by a <const>/</const>.<br><br>All lines of the schedule must have trailing spaces removed.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"statement-section statement-protocol\">\n   <div class=\"blk\">\n      <div class=\"title\">Input</div>\n      <div class=\"question-statement-input\"><strong>Line 1:</strong> Mrs. Knuth&rsquo;s <var>teacherAvailability</var><br><br><strong>Line 2:</strong> An integer <var>numStudents</var><br><br><strong>Next <var>numStudents</var> lines:</strong> <var>name</var> <var>instrument</var> <var>studentAvailability</var></div>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"blk\">\n      <div class=\"title\">Output</div>\n      <div class=\"question-statement-output\"><strong>10 lines:</strong> <var>schedule</var> per the rules above.
